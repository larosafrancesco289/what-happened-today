  "summary": "President Trump's executive order withdrawing the United States from 66 international organizations, including the UN Population Fund and climate treaty bodies, marks a sharp pivot toward isolationism. This sweeping retreat—suspending funding and participation—affects global efforts on migration, labor rights, and environmental protection, drawing sharp rebukes from diplomats who warn it undermines U.S. influence at a time when collective action is needed most. Coming amid rising geopolitical tensions, the move echoes Trump's first-term skepticism of multilateralism and signals a reorientation of American priorities away from shared governance.\n\nThis comes as U.S. forces escalated enforcement of sanctions by seizing two Venezuelan oil tankers from the shadow fleet in predawn raids across the North Atlantic and Caribbean Sea, heightening friction in the region's political crisis. Meanwhile, NATO launched its first coordinated response to suspected sabotage after another undersea cable was severed in the Baltic Sea, protecting critical infrastructure linking alliance members like Sweden and Finland. These incidents underscore hybrid threats to Western security, paralleling Israel's decision to allow thousands of displaced Palestinians to return on foot to northern Gaza following a hostage-release deal, offering rare humanitarian relief in the enclave's protracted conflict.\n\nLooking ahead, Trump's proposed $1.5 trillion military budget for 2027—the largest ever—aims to bolster advanced weaponry amid these global frictions, though it faces congressional scrutiny over taxpayer costs. In Rome, Pope Francis, 88, was declared stable after four weeks battling double pneumonia at Gemelli hospital, easing concerns for the global Catholic community as less frequent updates are expected.",
