  "summary": "US forces boarded a sanctioned Venezuelan oil tanker in the Indian Ocean after tracking it from the Caribbean to enforce oil sanctions on Venezuela. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced the action. The vessel's crew faces seizure.\n\nIsrael's security cabinet approved measures simplifying land purchases for Jews in the occupied West Bank. Critics including Palestinians and international observers state the move violates the Oslo Accords and accelerates annexation. Settlement expansion is expected next. Separately, displaced Palestinians crossed into northern Gaza on foot through a military zone after Israel lifted the blockade following a hostage deal. This follows Israel's decision yesterday to allow returns for over one million previously displaced Gazans. In the Baltic Sea region, NATO launched its first coordinated response after another deep-sea cable was severed amid a suspected sabotage campaign. Critical infrastructure operators and Baltic nations are affected.\n\nA Rapid Support Forces drone strike killed 24 displaced people including eight children near Er Rahad in central Sudan. The vehicle carried individuals fleeing fighting in Dubeiker, according to the Sudan Doctors Network. Aid access remains challenged in North Kordofan. Iran arrested reformists and activists amid prospects of US nuclear talks, weeks after nationwide unrest, while signaling openness to diplomacy. A US Fourth Circuit appeals court lifted a block on Trump executive orders halting federal DEI programs, pausing a lower court ruling and allowing agencies to resume enforcement. Senate Leader Chuck Schumer initiated Democratic talks offering White House restrictions on Trump immigration plans ahead of DHS funding expiration. SpaceX Falcon 9 launched NASA Crew-10 from Kennedy Space Center with astronauts Anne McClain, Nichole Ayers, Japan's Takuya Onishi, and Russia's Kirill Peskov to retrieve Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams after nine months on the ISS. Two more deaths raised the toll to 30 from a Meghalaya coal mine blast in an illegal rat-hole operation; rescue efforts continue.",
