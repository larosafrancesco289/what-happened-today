  "summary": "In a stunning escalation of U.S. interventionism, American special forces captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro in a nighttime raid on his Caracas residence, with the Trump administration announcing plans to temporarily govern the oil-rich nation amid crippling economic collapse and disputed elections. The operation, justified as countering narco-terrorism ties, has ignited fierce legal battles in Congress and U.S. courts over violations of international law, echoing post-9/11 debates on executive power. For Venezuela's 28 million citizens, long suffering hyperinflation and shortages, it raises hopes of stability but risks fueling anti-American backlash across Latin America, testing the legitimacy of Washington's hemispheric influence.\n\nThis bold move coincides with surging hybrid threats worldwide. NATO launched its first coordinated defense operation after a suspected sabotage severed a critical undersea cable in the Baltic Sea, prompting alliance navies from Sweden to Germany to patrol vital energy and data links long eyed by Russia. Across Asia, North Korea fired two missiles on erratic trajectories reaching 950km, skirting Japanese airspace and heightening alarms ahead of South Korea-China summits. In Africa, Rwanda-backed M23 rebels stormed Goma, displacing over a million in the Democratic Republic of Congo's key aid hub and worsening famine risks in a conflict that has killed millions since 1996.\n\nLooking ahead, officials from 15 Ukraine-supporting nations, including Britain, France, and Germany, convened in Kyiv—joined virtually by the U.S.—to map a strategy ending Russia's 1,000-day invasion. The talks, blending NATO and EU input, signal momentum toward peace negotiations, potentially easing blackouts and shortages for Ukraine's war-weary population while reshaping European security.",
