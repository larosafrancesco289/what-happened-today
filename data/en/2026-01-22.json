  "summary": "Russia's relentless assaults on Ukraine's power grid plunged Kyiv into crisis today, leaving 4,000 buildings without heat and 60% of the capital powerless as subzero temperatures grip the country. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy highlighted the plight of millions enduring blackouts, a stark reminder of Moscow's strategy to break civilian resolve through winter hardship. This escalation precedes a pivotal meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Zelenskyy, which could signal fresh U.S. pushes for peace talks amid stalled frontlines and war fatigue on both sides.\n\nThe energy sabotage echoes broader hybrid threats in Europe, prompting NATO to launch its first alliance-wide response after another Baltic Sea cable was severed, suspected to be deliberate attacks on critical undersea links vital for communications and trade. Meanwhile, in the Middle East, Israel permitted thousands of displaced Palestinians to return to northern Gaza after a hostage-release deal, easing strains in the war-torn enclave where families have trekked miles to reclaim homes amid ongoing fighting. Across Africa, Rwanda-backed rebels overran Goma in eastern Congo, displacing over one million and turning the aid hub into a humanitarian flashpoint with gunfire and shelling.\n\nLooking ahead, Trump's diplomatic overtures extend to Venezuela, where interim president Delcy Rodriguez is set to visit the U.S., potentially unlocking oil supplies in exchange for eased sanctions—a pragmatic move that could stabilize global energy markets while reshaping Washington's engagement with adversaries.",
