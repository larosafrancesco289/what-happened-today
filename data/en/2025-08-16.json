  "summary": "The Alaska summit between former US president Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, convened to address Ukraine, emerged as the defining diplomatic spectacle of the day, its opening handshake captured on video even as drivers of substance remained ambiguous. Analysts noted leaders departed without taking questions, a tactic that compounded uncertainty by leaving observers to parse body language and read bilateral signals rather than receive clarifying statements. Against this backdrop, many Ukrainians watch from the sidelines: significant constituencies were not invited to the talks and express fatigue and mistrust as others negotiate their country's future. The combination of opaque leader behavior and excluded stakeholders has heightened concerns that negotiations will produce misperceptions, entrench narratives rather than consensus, and generate unclear next steps for both diplomacy and security on the ground.\n\nAcross other theatres, developments reinforced a pattern of political action undermining negotiation and humanitarian protection. In parallel, moves in the occupied Palestinian territories—public taunts by a far‑right Israeli minister toward prisoner Marwan Barghouti and the approval of 3,401 homes in the E1 area—feed perceptions that settlement policy and polarising rhetoric could preclude a viable two‑state outcome, while commentary over the killing of Anas al‑Sharif highlighted divergent international reactions to political violence. Underscoring human vulnerability, separate incidents in migration and conflict settings—documents suggesting an Afghan veteran's family in the UK faces deportation after a data breach, and footage of parents struggling to feed children in besieged Darfur—illustrate acute protection gaps. At the same time, a UN plastic treaty deadlock and leaders' reticence in Alaska point to broader governance paralysis, even as a meteor shower over the UK offered a rare public pause. These converging strains reduce predictability for markets and raise pressure on humanitarian and multilateral capacity.",
