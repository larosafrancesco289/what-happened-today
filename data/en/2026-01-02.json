  "summary": "Tensions across the Taiwan Strait spiked as China's military wrapped up two days of live-fire drills encircling the island, prompting President Lai Ching-te to vow robust defenses against Beijing's expansionist aims. The exercises, the largest since Lai's May inauguration, simulated blockades and targeted key ports, threatening vital global shipping lanes that carry 50% of world container traffic and Taiwan's dominance in semiconductor production. This comes as the U.S. State Department condemned the maneuvers as unnecessary escalations, urging de-escalation alongside allies like Japan—underscoring America's commitment to deterrence in the Asia-Pacific amid fears of disrupted chip supplies for everything from smartphones to cars.\n\nIn eastern Congo, Rwanda-backed M23 rebels pushed into Goma city center, overrunning government troops amid gunfire and shelling that trapped over one million displaced residents in the key humanitarian hub. The advance intensifies a war displacing 7 million overall, endangering U.N. aid operations for millions facing famine. Meanwhile, NATO activated its first coordinated protocol against suspected sabotage of Baltic Sea cables, vital for European energy and data flows, pioneering defenses against hybrid threats from actors like Russia. Across Africa, Guinea's coup leader Gen. Mamady Doumbouya claimed over 80% victory in an election that barred rivals, entrenching military rule and fueling concerns of democratic backsliding from the Sahel to the Great Lakes.\n\nLooking ahead, a SpaceX Falcon 9 roared off from Kennedy Space Center at 7:03 p.m. Friday, carrying NASA's Crew-10—including Anne McClain, Nichole Ayers, Japan's Takuya Onishi, and Russia's Kirill Peskov—to retrieve astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, stuck on the ISS for nine months due to Boeing Starliner issues. The swap ensures uninterrupted science from the orbiting lab, highlighting reliable U.S.-private partnerships amid intensifying space race dynamics.",
