  "summary": "Rwanda-backed M23 rebels seized control of Goma on Wednesday, overrunning Congolese troops and plunging the eastern city—sheltering over one million displaced people—into chaos with sporadic gunfire. This dramatic advance escalates a conflict that has already killed tens of thousands since 2021, fueled by mineral riches and longstanding Rwanda-DRC tensions. The fall of this key aid hub threatens UN peacekeeping operations and risks a broader humanitarian catastrophe in Africa's Great Lakes region, where millions rely on faltering relief efforts.\n\nMeanwhile, Iran's government imposed sweeping shutdowns across 21 of its 31 provinces, including Tehran, closing businesses, universities, and offices to quell protests sparked by soaring inflation and subsidy cuts. The measures affect tens of millions amid economic strain from sanctions and mismanagement. In Gaza, Israel permitted thousands of displaced Palestinians to return to northern areas after opening a military zone bisecting the enclave, following a hostage-release deal that briefly eased a humanitarian deadlock—though intense fighting persists in other parts. Across the Atlantic, NATO launched its first coordinated naval operation in response to suspected sabotage of a Baltic Sea power cable linking Finland and Estonia, underscoring rising hybrid threats to critical infrastructure.\n\nLooking ahead, China's largest property developer Vanke reported massive losses on Thursday, signaling the real estate crisis—once confined to giants like Evergrande—is now engulfing even blue-chip firms, with trillions in exposure at risk. Beijing faces mounting pressure for bailouts to avert financial contagion, as global markets watch for ripples in the world's second-largest economy.",
