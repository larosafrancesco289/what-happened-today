  "summary": "A UN-mandated fact-finding mission reports that the Rapid Support Forces' 18-month siege and capture of El Fasher, capital of North Darfur in Sudan, inflicted conditions intended to destroy Zaghawa and Fur ethnic groups. The findings describe hallmarks of genocide amid Sudan's civil war between the RSF and Sudanese Armed Forces. Displaced populations face ongoing atrocities, escalating calls for international intervention.\n\nRwanda-backed M23 rebels overran Congolese troops and entered Goma, a safe-haven city in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. Gunfire and shelling occurred as over 1 million displaced people now shelter there, according to UN estimates. The incursion threatens Goma's role as a key humanitarian aid hub and raises risks of refugee outflows to neighboring countries. Separately, EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen arrived in Kyiv on the fourth anniversary of Russia's 2022 invasion. The visit reinforces EU solidarity as Ukraine faces frontline stalemate, tens of thousands dead, and reconstruction needs. On the same day, Russia struck infrastructure in Zaporizhzhia, damaging key facilities and affecting civilian power supply.\n\nA 6.8-magnitude earthquake struck off Malaysia's Sabah coast, the strongest in the country in 11 years and surpassing the 2015 Ranau 6.0 event that killed 18. Tremors reached Singapore with no immediate deaths reported; coastal communities assess infrastructure damage. Renewed clashes in South Sudan's Jonglei state displaced nearly 280,000 civilians, damaged health facilities, and increased cholera risks amid climate shocks. Four Russian soldiers reported commanders executing troops for refusing Ukraine frontline orders, affecting morale in the protracted invasion. Rogue Kenyan agencies recruited over 1,000 nationals to fight for Russia, prompting parliamentary calls for crackdown. NASA and SpaceX launched Crew-10 from Kennedy Space Center with NASA, Japanese, and Russian astronauts to retrieve stranded crew Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams from the ISS. Mexico deployed thousands of soldiers nationwide after the raid killing cartel leader El Mencho and 62 others; clashes have ebbed under lockdowns. UK police released former US ambassador Peter Mandelson on bail after his arrest on suspicion of misconduct tied to Jeffrey Epstein. Israel permitted thousands of displaced Palestinians to return to northern Gaza after a hostage release breakthrough, easing conditions amid ceasefire talks.\"}",
