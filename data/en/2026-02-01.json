  "summary": "US special envoy Steve Witkoff met Russia's Kirill Dmitriev, Putin's economic adviser, in Florida for constructive talks on ending the Ukraine war, signaling potential diplomatic progress ahead of broader Ukraine-Russia negotiations in Abu Dhabi. This comes as Moscow grapples with plummeting oil revenues—down sharply due to sanctions and market shifts—forcing tax hikes and increased borrowing that strain Russia's war chest and citizens alike. The Kremlin's fiscal woes, detailed in recent reports, weaken its leverage just as the Trump administration pushes for a resolution, altering global energy dynamics and security calculations.\n\nIn Gaza, Israeli strikes killed at least 26 people targeting Hamas commanders near Rafah, according to health officials, even as Israel plans a partial reopening of the crossing after two years to allow limited aid and exits—steps that could advance fragile cease-fire efforts amid mounting civilian tolls. Meanwhile, heavy rains triggered a collapse at a rebel-held coltan mine in Rubaya, eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, killing over 200 miners and disrupting 15% of the world's tantalum supply for smartphones and electronics, with rescue operations ongoing and tech firms bracing for shortages. Across the Atlantic, US Ambassador Laura Dogu landed in Caracas to reopen the American embassy after seven years, easing tensions post-Trump's recent military action and paving the way for prisoner swaps and economic talks that benefit Venezuelan families and US interests.\n\nBrightening the outlook, the Carter Center reported just 10 human Guinea worm cases worldwide in 2025—a record low after decades of work—edging closer to eradicating the debilitating parasite that once afflicted millions, honoring Jimmy Carter's legacy while underscoring global health triumphs amid persistent crises.",
