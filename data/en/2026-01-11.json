  "summary": "US President Donald Trump ordered large-scale airstrikes on ISIS targets across Syria on Saturday, announced by Central Command, in direct retaliation for last month's ambush that killed two American soldiers and a civilian interpreter. The operation ramps up pressure on the militants, who have regrouped amid Syria's chaos, underscoring Washington's commitment to protecting its forces even as the group shifts tactics to asymmetric attacks. This escalation follows years of fitful campaigns against ISIS, reminding the world of the persistent terrorist threat in the Middle East and its risks to US personnel.\n\nSigns of thawing US-Venezuela relations emerged on multiple fronts: Scott Bessent, overseeing US interests at the IMF and World Bank, signaled readiness to lift more sanctions on Caracas, potentially unlocking global lending for its battered oil economy. Hours later, Venezuela's Vice President Delcy Rodríguez secured US military help to retrieve a rogue oil tanker linked to a political rival, marking rare bilateral cooperation amid Maduro's leadership maneuvers. These developments reflect a pragmatic US pivot toward engagement, contrasting the isolation of recent years and hinting at stabilized energy markets.\n\nLooking ahead, Israel's decision to allow thousands of displaced Palestinians to return to northern Gaza after a hostage-release breakthrough eases acute humanitarian strains in the war-battered enclave, potentially paving the way for localized ceasefires. Meanwhile, NATO launched its first coordinated response to sabotage of Baltic Sea cables, bolstering defenses against hybrid threats from Russia that could disrupt Europe's energy and communications lifelines in the months to come.",
