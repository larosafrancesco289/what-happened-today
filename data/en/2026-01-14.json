  "summary": "Mass protests convulsed Tehran today, with demonstrators battling security forces over economic woes and repression, prompting Iranian leaders to accuse President Trump of inciting chaos as a pretext for military strikes. Trump's recent vow of 'strong action' against the regime intensified the rhetoric, exacerbating US-Iran frictions that have spiked oil prices and destabilized the Middle East since the 2018 nuclear deal withdrawal. An accompanying internet blackout in Iran stifled reporting, leaving ordinary Iranians cut off from the world.\n\nThis digital clampdown follows Uganda's nationwide internet shutdown ahead of divisive elections, revealing a pattern among autocracies to mute dissent and obscure vote-rigging claims. In northeast Thailand, a construction crane collapsed onto a passenger train from Bangkok, killing 22 and injuring dozens in a derailment that exposed chronic safety lapses in the country's expanding rail infrastructure, relied on by millions of daily commuters. Meanwhile, President Trump rebuffed warnings that his revived push to seize Greenland would fracture NATO alliances, even as bipartisan US senators advanced a bill barring funds for any such occupation.\n\nLooking ahead, a SpaceX Falcon 9 roared off from Kennedy Space Center carrying NASA astronauts Anne McClain and Nichole Ayers, Japan's Takuya Onishi, and Russia's Kirill Peskov toward the ISS, slated to relieve Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams after nine months marooned by Boeing Starliner glitches. Scientists confirmed 2025 as the third-hottest year on record despite Pacific cooling, driven by greenhouse gases—a stark signal for governments to accelerate emission cuts amid looming extreme weather threats.",
