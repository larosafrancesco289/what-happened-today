  "summary": "A car bomb assassinated Russian Lieutenant General Fanil Sarvarov outside his Moscow apartment today, marking the highest-profile strike inside Russia since the Ukraine war began. The attack, amid an ongoing investigation, underscores Kyiv's deepening reach into enemy territory even as Russian forces press advantages on the ground. Hours later, Moscow retaliated with its largest aerial assault in months: 650 drones and 36 missiles across 13 Ukrainian regions, killing three people including a four-year-old child and knocking out power for millions amid freezing winter temperatures. President Zelenskyy cited recent peace talk progress, but the barrage dims those prospects and heightens civilian risks ahead of Christmas.\n\nThis escalation coincides with NATO's first coordinated response to suspected sabotage of Baltic Sea cables, including a fresh severing that threatens vital undersea communications and energy links. Alliance navies are now patrolling to shield infrastructure from hybrid threats widely attributed to Russia, signaling a broader hardening of Western defenses. Meanwhile, in eastern Congo, Rwanda-backed M23 rebels overran government troops to enter Goma, sparking gunfire and shelling that has displaced over one million people and strained the U.N.'s main aid hub, risking a humanitarian collapse in a conflict killing thousands yearly.\n\nLooking ahead, Israel permitted thousands of displaced Palestinians to return on foot to northern Gaza after crossing a military zone, following a hostage-release deal. The move eases suffering for over two million residents but occurs as fighting persists elsewhere, hinting at fragile steps toward de-escalation amid the 15-month war.",
