  "summary": "Rwanda-backed M23 rebels overran Goma in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo today, routing government troops and plunging the city into chaos with gunfire and shelling. Over one million displaced people are now trapped inside, overwhelming U.N. aid hubs in what aid groups call a spiraling humanitarian emergency. This escalation revives longstanding accusations of Rwandan support for the insurgents, threatening further instability in a mineral-rich region that has seen millions flee violence since 2022 and underscoring how proxy conflicts exacerbate Africa's deadliest displacement crisis.\n\nThe Congo turmoil compounds other humanitarian shocks: floods triggered by heavy rains have killed over 100 people across South Africa, Mozambique, and Zimbabwe this year alone—70 in Zimbabwe, 30 in South Africa—displacing hundreds of thousands and prompting warnings of cholera, hunger, and crocodile attacks in inundated areas. Meanwhile, Italy's coastguard estimates up to 380 migrants drowned last week crossing the Mediterranean as Cyclone Harry battered southern Italy and Malta; a single shipwreck claimed 50 lives, with one survivor hospitalized. These parallel disasters highlight how climate extremes and conflict amplify migration perils and strain global relief efforts.\n\nForward signals are mixed: Israel allowed thousands of displaced Palestinians to trek back to northern Gaza after a hostage-release deal broke a deadlock, offering rare relief in the war-torn enclave. Yet NATO launched its first coordinated response to a severed Baltic Sea cable—suspected sabotage amid a string of underwater attacks—deploying defenses as members eye hybrid threats from Russia, while Donald Trump warned Iran that time is running out for a nuclear deal amid a U.S. military buildup in the Gulf.",
