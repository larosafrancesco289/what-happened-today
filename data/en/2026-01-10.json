  "summary": "Russia escalated its assault on Ukraine today by firing the Oreshnik hypersonic intermediate-range ballistic missile for the second time, targeting sites in the western part of the country. This rare deployment—capable of evading most defenses—signals Moscow's determination to press its advantage even as U.S.-led peace talks gain tentative momentum, raising alarms among Western allies about further infrastructure damage and the risk of broader conflict.\n\nNATO responded swiftly to mounting hybrid threats, launching its first coordinated operation to safeguard Baltic Sea infrastructure after a deep-sea cable was severed in a suspected sabotage campaign. The move highlights how Russia's war in Ukraine reverberates across Europe, straining transatlantic energy and communications links. In the Middle East, Israel allowed thousands of displaced Palestinians to return to northern Gaza following a breakthrough hostage-release deal, temporarily easing humanitarian woes in the enclave—yet Syria's army simultaneously resumed operations in Aleppo's Kurdish district after a ceasefire collapsed, urging fighters to surrender and stoking fears of renewed clashes.\n\nAustralia declared a state of disaster in Victoria as bushfires razed 150,000 hectares and destroyed homes amid a scorching 40°C heatwave, forcing evacuations and reviving traumatic memories of the 2019-2020 Black Summer that claimed 33 lives. Parallel blazes in South Africa's Kouga region prompted helicopter drops and resident flight, underscoring a global surge in climate-fueled wildfires that tests emergency responses and imperils communities from Melbourne to the Eastern Cape.",
