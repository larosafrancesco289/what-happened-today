  "summary": "Israel's campaign in Gaza and the domestic and international responses to it framed much of today's geopolitical news, as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu defended plans for Gaza amid sustained UN Security Council criticism while large-scale protests at home intensified opposition to any expansion of the war. Netanyahu argued that hostages were being deliberately deprived by Hamas, a claim that has become central to his justification for military steps, even as protesters and members of civil society pressed their government over humanitarian and legal concerns. Against this backdrop, UN Secretary-General António Guterres condemned the killing of five journalists in Gaza and called for accountability, underscoring the contested information environment in which civilian harm and press safety are recurring flashpoints complicating diplomatic efforts and shaping international scrutiny.\n\nBeyond the Middle East, a disparate set of crises and policy moves illustrated strains on state capacity and market confidence. Record heat across Spain and Portugal fanned wildfires that forced evacuations and stretched emergency services, while a deadly explosion at a Pennsylvania steel plant and a high-speed train security incident in Britain highlighted industrial safety and transport vulnerabilities in developed states. In parallel, Tehran warned that forthcoming IAEA talks will be \"complicated\", signaling friction in nuclear diplomacy even as Washington extended a 90-day pause on tariffs with Beijing — a short-term trade accommodation that eases immediate market frictions but leaves strategic competition unresolved. Against this backdrop, debates over crime in Washington and questions about electoral legitimacy in Cameroon reflected divergent governance challenges. Collectively these developments underscore how environmental shocks, security incidents, and contested political authority are converging to complicate policy coordination, tighten risk premia and test public trust.",
