  "summary": "Israel took a significant step toward easing Gaza's humanitarian crisis today, permitting thousands of displaced Palestinians to return on foot to northern areas after resolving a hostage-release deadlock. This follows the extraction of shrapnel from freed Israeli women hostages—held alone in tunnels for eight months since the October 7 attack—highlighting the war's enduring brutality. Hours later, Israel reopened the Rafah crossing after nearly a year, allowing 150 wounded Gazans daily to seek treatment in Egypt and others to reunite with families. These moves signal potential de-escalation in the 14-month conflict, offering relief to 2.3 million residents in the blockaded enclave amid fears of famine.\n\nThe developments coincide with escalating crises elsewhere. In eastern Congo, Rwanda-backed M23 rebels overran government troops and entered Goma amid gunfire, trapping over 1 million displaced people in the key aid hub and threatening U.N. operations in a war-torn region. This comes as NATO launched its first alliance-wide response to suspected sabotage of a Baltic Sea power cable, deploying ships to patrol vital undersea infrastructure after repeated cuts that have heightened fears of hybrid warfare from Russia. Meanwhile, Russia-U.S. talks delayed Ukraine peace negotiations by days, prolonging uncertainty for Kyiv's defenders and global energy markets.\n\nLooking ahead, SpaceX's Crew-10 mission lifted off from Florida with NASA astronauts Anne McClain and Nichole Ayers, Japan's Takuya Onishi, and Russia's Kirill Peskov, set to retrieve Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams—stranded nine months on the ISS—and dock by Saturday, restoring full crew operations.",
