  "summary": "NATO launched its first alliance-wide response today to suspected sabotage after another deep-sea cable was severed in the Baltic Sea, linking Finland and Germany. This marks the third such incident in months, amid fears of hybrid warfare targeting critical infrastructure—likely aimed at sowing discord among NATO's eastern flank. The coordinated bolstering of defenses underscores the alliance's shift from deterrence to active protection, as members like Estonia and Sweden report heightened Russian shadow activities since the Ukraine invasion.\n\nViolence surged elsewhere: in Nigeria's Kwara state, jihadists massacred 162 villagers in Woro and Nuku, rounding them up and shooting in the deadliest attack this year on the northwest's restive communities, prompting troop deployments. Across Africa, U.N.-backed experts warned of famine engulfing Sudan's Darfur region, where army-paramilitary clashes have displaced millions and choked aid, threatening mass starvation for 25 million. In the U.S., Ryan Wesley Routh received a life sentence for his September 2024 attempt to assassinate Donald Trump at a Florida golf course, a stark reminder of political violence amid election strains.\n\nForward steps emerged amid the gloom: Israel permitted hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians to return on foot to northern Gaza after a hostage-release breakthrough eased a military blockade, hinting at phased de-escalation. The U.S. and Iran scheduled direct nuclear talks in Oman, testing restraint as an American carrier nears and Trump issues threats. Meanwhile, Indonesia and Australia inked a security pact to counter China tensions, fortifying Indo-Pacific alliances.",
