  "summary": "The South Korean musical 'Maybe Happy Ending' achieved significant recognition by winning six awards at the Tony Awards, highlighting the growing international presence of South Korean performing arts. In Iran, authorities have extended restrictions on dog walking, citing religious reasons, amidst a reported rise in pet ownership that some interpret as a subtle form of social dissent. Meanwhile, former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert commented that many Israelis perceive the ongoing military operations in Gaza, now in their 20th month, as politically motivated rather than purely strategic.\n\nIn Italy, a recent referendum on citizenship failed to meet the required 50% voter turnout threshold, with only about 30% participation, rendering the results non-binding. Historical insights into Indian politics reveal that aides of former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi advocated for a presidential system to centralize power and limit parliamentary and judicial roles. Additionally, social media campaigns have brought attention to an ancient African writing system, challenging prevailing misconceptions about the continent's historical knowledge systems. In the United States, approximately 500 Marines are on standby amid ongoing immigration protests in Los Angeles, where a journalist was recently struck by a rubber bullet during live coverage. Separately, opposition figure Enrique Anaya was arrested in El Salvador on money laundering charges, reflecting ongoing political tensions.",
