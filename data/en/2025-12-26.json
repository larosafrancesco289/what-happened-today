  "summary": "Japan's Cabinet approved a record 9 trillion yen ($58 billion) defense budget for fiscal 2026, the largest ever, to acquire cruise missiles and unmanned systems for strike-back capabilities against China. This escalation fortifies coastal defenses in the face of Beijing's growing assertiveness around disputed islands and Taiwan, marking Tokyo's sharpest pivot from postwar pacifism amid the most severe security environment since World War II. Allies like the U.S. welcome the move as it bolsters deterrence in the Indo-Pacific.\n\nMeanwhile, NATO mounted its first coordinated naval response in the Baltic Sea after a critical undersea cable was severed, suspected as sabotage amid hybrid threats from Russia that endanger Europe's communications lifelines. Echoing such brinkmanship, North Korea unveiled the completed hull of a new nuclear-powered submarine following a missile test, heightening tensions on the Korean Peninsula as a U.S. vessel visits South Korea. Further south, Rwanda-backed M23 rebels overran Goma in eastern Congo, shelling positions and trapping over one million displaced people in the lakeside city, straining U.N. aid efforts.\n\nLooking ahead, SpaceX's Crew-10 mission blasted off Friday from Kennedy Space Center, carrying NASA, Japanese, and Russian astronauts to the ISS to finally retrieve Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams after nine months stranded by technical glitches. The handoff ensures uninterrupted station operations, a rare bright spot of multinational cooperation amid earthly conflicts.",
