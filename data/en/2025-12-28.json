  "summary": "Russia hammered Kyiv with ballistic missiles and drones on Saturday, killing one civilian and wounding 27 in apartment blocks, as rescuers sifted rubble amid ongoing explosions. The barrage, the latest in a string of winter assaults on Ukraine's power grid and cities, came hours before President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was due to meet Donald Trump in Florida for talks on ending the three-year war. President Vladimir Putin, fresh from the strikes, warned that Moscow would pursue all its goals by force if Kyiv shuns peace negotiations—a stark message stiffening lines just as faint diplomatic hopes flicker.\n\nNATO launched its first alliance-wide response to suspected sabotage after rebels cut another Baltic Sea communications cable, underscoring hybrid threats to undersea infrastructure that powers transatlantic economies and defenses—threats many fingers point at Russia amid the Ukraine grind. Farther afield, Rwanda-backed M23 rebels stormed into Congo's Goma, trading fire with retreating troops and trapping over 1 million displaced people in the lakeside aid hub, compounding a crisis that has uprooted 7 million in eastern Congo's mineral-rich chaos.\n\nSunday's Trump-Zelenskyy summit in Florida offers a potential pivot, with the US president pushing for a ceasefire that could freeze frontlines and reshape alliances—even as recent strikes test resolve. Elsewhere, Israel eased its grip by allowing thousands of displaced Palestinians to trek back to northern Gaza's ruins post-hostage deal, while recognizing Somaliland's sovereignty to gain a Horn of Africa foothold, moves that hint at de-escalation in one theater and realignments in another.",
