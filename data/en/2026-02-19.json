  "summary": "U.S.-backed Kurdish forces withdrew oversight from 24 detention sites in Syria holding thousands of ISIS members and families. The move has created chaos in the prison system. Risks of mass escapes affect Middle East security. International monitors are assessing threats and planning containment measures for global counterterrorism.\n\nRussia-Ukraine negotiations, mediated by the U.S. in Geneva, extended to a second day with focus on territorial disputes, a major point of disagreement between the parties. This follows their resumption yesterday. Short sessions indicate limited progress so far. Separately, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un unveiled nuclear-capable rocket launchers as a gift ahead of the Ninth Workers' Party Congress. The display affects neighbors and the U.S. amid Korean Peninsula tensions. Party congress discussions are expected on arsenal expansion.\n\nRwanda-backed rebels entered Goma in eastern Congo, overrunning government troops and trapping over 1 million displaced people inside the city amid gunfire and shelling. The U.N. is evaluating crisis response. In Gaza, Israel lifted restrictions allowing displaced Palestinians to cross a military zone into northern areas on foot, affecting hundreds of thousands returning after hostage deal progress. President Trump hosted the first Board of Peace meeting with representatives from 24 countries on Gaza reconstruction; some U.S. allies expressed wariness. Aid trucks delivered food to Sudan's Kordofan region after a two-year blockade amid drone attacks hindering relief for famine-threatened civilians.",
