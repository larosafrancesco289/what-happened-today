  "summary": "Rwanda-backed M23 rebels seized Goma, the Democratic Republic of Congo's key eastern aid hub, on Friday amid intense gunfire and shelling, trapping over 1 million displaced people and disrupting UN operations. The fall of this lakeside city of 2 million follows months of rebel advances fueled by longstanding mineral disputes and Rwanda's alleged support, deepening a conflict that has already killed tens of thousands and drawn in neighboring states. For ordinary Congolese, it means severed supply lines for food and medicine, as clashes rage nearby.\n\nThis African crisis unfolded as Israel allowed hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians to cross back into northern Gaza after a hostage-release breakthrough, yet Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to disarm Hamas and demilitarize the enclave entirely, stalling reconstruction and Palestinian statehood dreams. Meanwhile, NATO launched its first coordinated patrols in response to suspected sabotage of a vital Baltic Sea power cable linking Finland and Estonia, amid fears of Russian hybrid warfare—a tactic echoing a deadly drone strike on a Ukrainian passenger train carrying nearly 200 people, which President Zelenskyy branded terrorism.\n\nLooking ahead, Netanyahu's hardline stance signals prolonged Israeli operations in Gaza, while U.S. Census data shows population growth slowing to 0.5%—reaching 342 million—due to President Trump's immigration crackdown, raising alarms among economists about looming labor shortages and sluggish GDP growth for businesses and workers.",
