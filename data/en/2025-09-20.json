  "summary": "Israel escalated its assault on Gaza City today, striking a tent in the urban centre and killing at least two children, according to local reports, as observers urged restraint and independent investigations. The attack coincides with rising diplomatic moves: Portugal plans to recognise a Palestinian state next week and the UN General Assembly voted to let Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas address its annual gathering by video, moves that increase international attention and pressure. The combination of intensified fighting and imminent recognitions could prompt immediate diplomatic protests, emergency UN sessions, or shifts in aid access; the next step is likely urgent calls for inquiry and for parties to avoid further civilian harm.\n\nNATO accused Russia of violating Estonian airspace; Moscow denies the claim and Estonia has requested urgent consultations, while Poland scrambled jets after strikes in western Ukraine. These incidents increase the immediate risk of miscalculation and could unsettle regional markets and energy supplies. First responders said an RSF drone strike killed 75 worshippers in El Fasher, worsening humanitarian needs, and a UN report says Iran uses drones, facial recognition and a government-backed app to enforce hijab rules, raising civil-liberties concerns. On a different note, at least 60 states have ratified a new oceans treaty that will enter into force in January, triggering new marine protections and regulatory changes.",
