  "summary": "Israel took a rare step toward easing Gaza's humanitarian plight today, allowing thousands of displaced Palestinians to return to the northern part of the enclave after a breakthrough in hostage negotiations. Families crossed a heavily militarized zone on foot to reclaim homes shattered by 15 months of war, alleviating overcrowding in the south where over 1.9 million people have been squeezed into tent cities. This cautious concession follows the release of several captives and signals fragile progress in ceasefire talks, even as Israeli forces maintain operations against Hamas—offering ordinary Gazans a glimmer of normalcy amid devastation that has killed over 44,000.\n\nThe relief contrasted sharply with escalations elsewhere. In eastern Congo, Rwanda-backed M23 rebels overran government troops and entered Goma, shelling the lakeside city and trapping more than one million residents in the region's main aid hub; UN officials warned of collapsed humanitarian operations. Meanwhile, Iranian security forces unleashed a nationwide crackdown on anti-government protesters, with eyewitnesses reporting dozens killed in cities like Tehran and Isfahan, drawing global condemnation. President Trump amplified pressure by imposing 25% tariffs on imports from Iran's trading partners—China, Brazil, Turkey, and Russia—hiking costs for global exporters and squeezing Tehran's oil-funded economy.\n\nLooking ahead, Trump's administration is reviewing diplomatic signals from Tehran, where officials declared readiness for war but openness to talks following US warnings over the protest deaths. This delicate dance could shape Middle East stability, while in orbit, SpaceX's Crew-10 mission launched from Kennedy Space Center with NASA astronauts Anne McClain and Nichole Ayers, Japan's Takuya Onishi, and Russia's Kirill Peskov—poised to finally bring home Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams after nine months stranded on the ISS, restoring NASA's routine rotations.",
