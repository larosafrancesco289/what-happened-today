  "summary": "Rwanda-backed rebels defeated Congolese troops and entered Goma in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, prompting gunfire and shelling. Over one million displaced residents are trapped in the city, affecting U.N. aid operations that serve as a humanitarian hub. The incursion threatens regional stability as fighting escalates in the area.\n\nIn Pakistan, a suicide bomber detonated at a Shiite mosque in Islamabad during Friday prayers, killing at least 30 worshippers and wounding over 130. Police are investigating the attack, which heightens risks of sectarian violence amid regional instability. Separately, U.S. and Iranian diplomats began talks in Oman on Iran's nuclear program, amid a U.S. military buildup. Progress may occur on nuclear limits, though Iranian officials express doubts over U.S. demands on other issues. An unidentified assailant shot Russian Lt. Gen. Vladimir Alekseyev, deputy chief of military intelligence, multiple times in Moscow; he was hospitalized in an incident echoing prior attacks on military figures during the Ukraine conflict.\n\nNATO launched a coordinated response after another Baltic Sea cable severance, amid a suspected sabotage campaign targeting infrastructure; Baltic allies increased defenses against hybrid threats attributed by some to Russia. Nigerian troops deployed to villages Woro and Nuku in Kwara state following jihadist attacks that killed 162 residents. Israel permitted hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians to cross into northern Gaza after a hostage release ended a military zone restriction, though Israeli forces killed two Palestinians in strikes in northern Gaza and Khan Younis amid limited Rafah crossings. NASA and SpaceX launched the Crew-10 mission from Florida on a Falcon 9, carrying four astronauts to the ISS to enable the return of two NASA crew members stuck for nine months. The EU Commission found TikTok's infinite scroll and notifications addictive, violating the Digital Services Act and risking a fine up to 6% of ByteDance's global revenue. A U.S. appeals court in the Fourth Circuit lifted an injunction on Trump administration executive orders halting federal DEI programs. A Nigerian court ordered Britain to pay 420 million pounds to families of 21 coal miners killed by colonial authorities.",
