  "summary": "Qatar hosted a summit of Muslim leaders today to coordinate a response to the Gaza attacks, marking a diplomatic push that could change regional pressure on Israel and access to humanitarian aid. The meeting came as Gaza City was hit by Israeli strikes that health authorities in Gaza reported killed at least 49 people and displaced about 6,000 more among roughly 900,000 residents; those figures are difficult to independently verify. Leaders discussed possible political and aid measures and may press for immediate safe corridors, international monitoring, or an appeal to the UN. Decisions or a joint statement in the next 48 hours could determine whether aid reaches besieged areas or whether diplomacy escalates.\n\nSecurity and governance news also stood out: Romania and Poland scrambled jets over drone threats tied to the war in Ukraine, Kyiv reported a drone strike on one of Russia’s largest oil refineries, and Germany’s North Rhine-Westphalia election tested Merz’s coalition. A non-conflict item: Australia will spend at least US$8 billion to upgrade a Western Australia shipyard for nuclear submarines under AUKUS. These developments affect markets, defence planning and rights: higher defence spending and energy-targeted strikes can lift fuel prices and spur NATO to bolster air defences, while declines in global press freedom and UN condemnation of a massacre in Haiti highlight risks to human rights and governance. NATO and EU officials will review responses in coming days.",
