  "summary": "Russian forces seized the strategic town of Siversk in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region on December 24, after Ukrainian troops withdrew to avert encirclement. Held by Kyiv since early 2022, the stronghold's fall erodes Ukraine's defensive lines amid grinding attrition warfare and dims prospects for negotiations over proposed demilitarized zones. The advance followed an overnight Ukrainian drone barrage targeting Moscow and Tula, where Russian air defenses downed 172 UAVs and contained an industrial fire—evidence of Kyiv's push to impose costs deep inside Russia even as its ground positions weaken.\n\nMeanwhile, in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, Rwanda-backed M23 rebels overran government troops to enter Goma city, triggering gunfire and shelling that crammed over 1 million displaced people into the lakeside hub. Aid workers warn of surging risks to civilians and operations, as the incursion threatens to unravel fragile regional truces and exacerbate the world's largest displacement crisis. This African flashpoint echoes broader instability, including NATO's launch of its first coordinated patrols in the Baltic Sea after another suspected sabotage of a critical undersea cable, prompting allies to bolster defenses against hybrid attacks on Europe's infrastructure.\n\nLooking ahead, SpaceX's Crew-10 mission lifted off from Kennedy Space Center on Friday, carrying NASA, JAXA, and Roscosmos astronauts to relieve Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams—stranded on the ISS for nine months due to Boeing Starliner's technical woes. Docking Saturday, the handover ensures uninterrupted station operations and underscores commercial spaceflight's reliability amid geopolitical tensions in orbit.",
