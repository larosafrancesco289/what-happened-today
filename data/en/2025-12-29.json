  "summary": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky met with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago on Monday, presenting a revised 20-point peace plan for the war with Russia amid widespread doubts about Moscow's willingness to negotiate. The high-stakes talks, the first since Trump's election victory, could reshape U.S. policy toward the conflict, potentially accelerating diplomacy or highlighting irreconcilable differences as Kyiv seeks security guarantees and Russia demands territorial concessions. This comes as both sides trade accusations of bad faith, with the plan building on prior proposals that stalled over issues like Crimea's status.\n\nTensions rippled across strategic waterways elsewhere: NATO launched its first coordinated response to suspected sabotage after another undersea cable was severed in the Baltic Sea, deploying ships and aircraft to safeguard Europe's critical data and energy links potentially targeted by hybrid actors like Russia. Beijing, meanwhile, kicked off massive 'Justice Mission 2025' military drills around Taiwan, imposing 10-hour restrictions across five sea and air zones and prompting Taipei to scramble jets in a show of force that heightens risks to global trade routes through the strait. In Gaza, Israel opened a military zone to allow thousands of displaced Palestinians to return north on foot following a hostage release, a tentative step amid fragile ceasefire talks.\n\nLooking ahead, a SpaceX Falcon 9 successfully launched NASA's Crew-10 from Florida, carrying astronauts Anne McClain, Nichole Ayers, Japan's Takuya Onishi, and Russia's Kirill Peskov to the ISS. Their mission will enable the return of stranded crew members Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams after nine months, restoring full operations and underscoring the reliability of international space cooperation even amid earthly conflicts.",
