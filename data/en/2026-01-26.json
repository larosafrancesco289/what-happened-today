  "summary": "Rwanda-backed M23 rebels seized Goma, the largest city in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, overrunning government troops amid intense gunfire and shelling that displaced over one million people. Many are now sheltering in the very aid hub they once relied on, exacerbating what the UN calls one of the world's most neglected humanitarian crises. This escalation, following years of simmering conflict fueled by mineral riches and regional rivalries, threatens to destabilize the Great Lakes region further, complicating peace efforts led by African Union mediators.\n\nMeanwhile, authoritarian regimes doubled down on control elsewhere: in Iran, security forces crushed protests with lethal force during a nationwide communications blackout, with videos showing brutality against demonstrators and bystanders that has sharpened global scrutiny of Tehran's stability. In Myanmar, the junta-backed party declared a majority win in elections widely dismissed as fraudulent by watchdogs, entrenching military rule and dimming hopes for Aung San Suu Kyi's opposition amid her continued detention. This comes as NATO launched its first coordinated response to suspected sabotage of undersea cables in the Baltic Sea, bolstering defenses against hybrid threats that echo Russia's tactics in Ukraine.\n\nLooking ahead, glimmers of progress emerged in Gaza, where Israel conducted a large-scale operation to recover the body of hostage Ran Gvili, held by Hamas since October 2023, while allowing thousands of displaced Palestinians to return north of a military zone following a hostage deal. These steps signal potential advances in ceasefire talks. In space, NASA and SpaceX launched Crew-10 from Kennedy Space Center—astronauts Anne McClain, Nichole Ayers, Japan's Takuya Onishi, and Russia's Kirill Peskov—to relieve Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams after nine months on the ISS, ensuring uninterrupted operations.",
