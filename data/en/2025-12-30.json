  "summary": "China's People's Liberation Army pressed on with the second day of its 'Justice Mission 2025' live-fire drills encircling Taiwan, deploying warships, jets, and missiles in a show of force to deter external backing for the island. Taiwan scrambled over 50 aircraft and 20 vessels in response, while the U.S. and Japan condemned the maneuvers as destabilizing. This escalation follows Beijing's fury over Taiwan's new president Lai Ching-te's independence-leaning rhetoric, threatening vital sea lanes that carry half of global container shipping and risking a broader confrontation in the Asia-Pacific.\n\nMeanwhile, Middle East fissures deepened as Saudi jets struck Yemen's Mukalla port after a UAE weapons shipment reached separatist forces, straining the once-close Riyadh-Abu Dhabi alliance amid the grinding Yemen war and imperiling Red Sea trade. In Africa, parallel horrors unfolded: the UN branded Sudan's El-Fasher the 'epicentre of human suffering' post-RSF paramilitary capture, with civilians lacking water amid famine threatening millions; Rwanda-backed M23 rebels overran Congo's Goma, shelling the city and displacing over a million into already strained aid hubs, fueling regional refugee waves.\n\nLooking ahead, the U.S. dangled a 15-year security guarantee to Ukraine as part of a prospective Russia peace deal, which President Zelenskyy said Kyiv and allies are scrutinizing—a potential stabilizer for Europe if Moscow bites, reshaping NATO's eastern flank. NATO, meanwhile, kicked off its first coordinated patrols against suspected Baltic Sea cable sabotage, signaling heightened vigilance against hybrid threats from Russia.",
