  "summary": "Russian missile and drone strikes plunged much of Kyiv into darkness and cold today, cutting heat, water, and power to millions amid subzero temperatures just as Ukraine, Russia, and the U.S. began talks to end their four-year war. The barrage, one of Moscow's largest recently, killed at least five and wounded dozens, underscoring the Kremlin's willingness to intensify civilian suffering even as diplomats probe for cease-fire openings. This escalation follows Ukraine's recent deep strikes into Russia, highlighting a vicious cycle that dims hopes for peace and burdens ordinary Ukrainians with blackouts during the harshest winter.\n\nAcross conflict zones, humanitarian crises mounted. In eastern Congo, Rwanda-backed M23 rebels overran government troops to enter Goma, trapping over one million displaced people amid gunfire and shelling that overwhelmed U.N. aid operations. Similarly, Gaza's tent camps erupted in disease outbreaks from sewage and waste, afflicting thousands of displaced families in Israel's ongoing war and demanding urgent global intervention. Meanwhile, NATO launched its first coordinated patrols in the Baltic Sea after another undersea cable sabotage, signaling alliance-wide vigilance against hybrid threats from adversaries like Russia.\n\nLooking ahead, Syria's government under President Ahmed al-Sharaa extended a cease-fire with Kurdish forces in the northeast hours after the prior truce expired, aiming to consolidate nationwide control but risking renewed clashes if talks falter. In Gaza, Israel allowed thousands of displaced Palestinians to cross a military zone back to the north following a hostage deal breakthrough, easing immediate strains but exposing returnees to persistent dangers.",
