  "summary": "The day is framed by escalating strain on humanitarian operations in Gaza as more than 100 aid organisations warn that repeated denials of authorisation amount to the ‘‘weaponisation’’ of relief, constraining deliveries to civilians even as mediators race to secure a single, comprehensive hostage-release deal. Negotiators say a compact release could be achieved in coming weeks, potentially ahead of Israel’s announced plans to expand military operations; that timetable places intense pressure on both the diplomacy and the logistics of aid corridors. These intersecting dynamics—denied access, hostage leverage and the prospect of intensified combat—compress the window for safe evacuations and complicate third-party mediation, raising questions about the durability of any agreement reached under imminent operational deadlines and under varying interpretations of authority over humanitarian gating.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, other global currents underscore a shift toward securitised state responses and contested civic processes. In the Pacific, Australia’s $328m security and business pact with Vanuatu illustrates renewed influence competition, while Russia’s new limits on WhatsApp and Telegram signal tighter domestic controls framed as anti‑sabotage measures amid wartime information management. Economic tools are evident in Brazil’s planned ‘Sovereign Brazil’ support to firms hit by US tariffs, reflecting how states are deploying fiscal cushions to offset external pressure. Closer to democratic norms, India’s dispute over alleged ‘‘vote theft’’ and high‑profile legal battles — from a former first lady’s threat to sue to a forensic‑centred murder conviction — highlight strains on public trust in institutions. Meanwhile, widespread wildfires across southern Europe and the Balkans add a climatic humanitarian dimension. Underscoring these trends, the mix of constrained aid, securitisation and economic shielding points to a more fragmented international landscape with direct implications for humanitarian access, market volatility and diplomatic bandwidth.",
