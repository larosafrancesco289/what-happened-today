  "summary": "A senior United Nations official warned today that Gaza City risks becoming 'cataclysmic' as Israeli tanks deepened their push into the territory’s largest urban center, prompting thousands of Palestinians to flee south. Local authorities and aid groups described an escalating humanitarian crisis, with shortages of water, food and medical care reported and calls for protected evacuation routes and humanitarian corridors. Israel says its operations target militant infrastructure; humanitarian agencies say civilians are caught in the fighting. The immediate next step is whether those corridors can be negotiated and secured: relief organizations and the UN say they must be established within days to prevent mass civilian casualties and a wider collapse of services.\n\nOther developments clustered around security, rights and science. On security, France said UN sanctions on Iran could be reimposed by month’s end if talks fail and the US approved a $780 million Javelin sale to Poland, moves likely to influence NATO deterrence and markets. A UN report says Iran uses drones and facial recognition to police hijab compliance, raising civil‑liberty concerns. Non‑conflict items included a magnitude 7.8 quake in Russia’s Far East, called an aftershock by USGS, and a NASA/SpaceX crew launch to rotate the ISS, preserving research schedules. France’s anti‑austerity turnout is contested—organizers claim up to a million, authorities about half—creating near‑term political pressure on Macron, with key policy choices due in weeks.",
