  "summary": "Russia made its biggest territorial gains in Ukraine since the full-scale invasion began in 2022, capturing over 5,600 square kilometers—nearly 1% of Ukrainian land—this year alone. The advances, concentrated in the east, prompted President Zelensky to appoint intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov as his aide, nominate Mykhailo Fedorov for defense minister, and order frontline evacuations. This surge intensifies pressure on Kyiv ahead of key security talks with allies, underscoring Moscow's grinding strategy amid Western fatigue and winter hardships for Ukrainian troops.\n\nIn Yemen, longstanding Gulf rivalries boiled over as the UAE-backed Southern Transitional Council in Aden unveiled a constitution for an independent southern state, demanding recognition from other factions. Hours later, the Saudi-supported government deployed troops to reclaim separatist-held areas, shattering fragile ceasefires and risking wider violence in a nation already reeling from years of civil war. Meanwhile, NATO launched its first coordinated operation to probe and protect after a deep-sea cable sabotage in the Baltic Sea, heightening fears of Russian hybrid tactics mirroring Ukraine's infrastructure woes.\n\nLooking ahead, a SpaceX Falcon 9 roared off from Kennedy Space Center on Friday evening, carrying NASA astronauts Anne McClain and Nichole Ayers, Japan's Takuya Onishi, and Russia's Kirill Peskov to the ISS. Arriving Saturday, Crew-10 will finally rotate out Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams after nine months in orbit, a reminder of international cooperation amid earthly conflicts—and a step toward NASA's next Mars ambitions.",
