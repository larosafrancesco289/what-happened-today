  "summary": "U.S. and Iran held the second round of nuclear talks in Geneva on Tuesday. The U.S. deployed an aircraft carrier near the region. Iran conducted military drills in the Strait of Hormuz, which handles 20 percent of global seaborne oil trade. The talks address Iran's nuclear program. Progress could reduce tensions; both sides report no agreement yet.\n\nSyrian Army forces advanced into Kurdish-held regions in northern Syria, capturing areas in Hasakah and Deir ez-Zor provinces. The moves affect 3 million Kurds in the northeast and approach full control of Syrian territory by Damascus for the first time since 2011. In central Africa, Rwanda-backed M23 rebels entered Goma in eastern Congo, overrunning government troops amid gunfire and trapping 1 million displaced people in the city. United Nations aid operations face increased strain. Separately in Geneva, Russia and Ukraine held peace talks on territorial issues as President Trump pressed Kyiv to cede land held by Russia since 2014.\n\nIsrael permitted hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians to return to northern Gaza after a hostage release agreement ended a prior deadlock. The move follows four hostages freed by Hamas. NATO deployed ships and aircraft for its first coordinated response after another deep-sea cable cut in the Baltic Sea, suspected as sabotage. Investigations target state actors. NASA and SpaceX launched Crew-10 on a Falcon 9 rocket from Florida, carrying U.S. astronauts Anne McClain and Nichole Ayers, Japan's Takuya Onishi, and Russia's Kirill Peskov to the International Space Station. The four will retrieve two stranded crew members and support operations for nine months.",
