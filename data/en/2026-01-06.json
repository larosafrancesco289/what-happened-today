  "summary": "Venezuela plunged into turmoil as the opposition swore in an interim president in Caracas, hours after US forces abducted President Nicolás Maduro in a dramatic raid. Maduro, facing drug trafficking charges, pleaded not guilty in a New York court, drawing sharp condemnation from leaders across Latin America and beyond. The unprecedented intervention revives memories of US-backed regime changes in the region, risking broader instability as allies like Russia and China decry it as a violation of sovereignty, while testing Washington's legal and diplomatic limits.\n\nIn Gaza, the fragile truce frayed further when Israeli airstrikes hit a tent in al-Mawasi, killing a five-year-old girl and her uncle, pushing the death toll since the ceasefire to 422. Palestinians renewed demands to open the Rafah crossing for aid, even as Israel permitted thousands of displaced Gazans to trek back to northern areas following a hostage release deal—a tentative step amid the enclave's deep divisions. Meanwhile, in Switzerland's Crans-Montana ski resort, residents mourned 40 lives lost in a New Year's bar fire, one of the country's deadliest, prompting urgent calls for safety overhauls that could ripple through Europe's tourism sector.\n\nLooking ahead, Syrian and Israeli officials prepare to resume US-mediated security talks in Paris, aiming for a buffer zone deal along the Golan Heights to ease recent flare-ups. This comes as Guinea's Supreme Court upheld junta leader Gen. Mamadi Doumbouya's presidential win with 86.7% of the vote, signaling a junta-to-civilian transition in West Africa. Separately, a 6.2-magnitude earthquake rattled western Japan with aftershocks but spared major damage, underscoring the region's vigilant seismic readiness.",
