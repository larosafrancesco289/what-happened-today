  "summary": "President Trump said today he will not allow Israel to annex the West Bank, a move that changes U.S. signals to Israeli leaders and could force Prime Minister Netanyahu to revise or delay annexation plans. The declaration was coupled with wider assertive actions: Mr. Trump also announced 100 percent tariffs on imported drugs, trucks and kitchen cabinets and pressed Turkey to halt Russian oil purchases amid F-35 negotiations, signaling a more transactional U.S. posture on trade and security. The combined decisions link American commercial pressure to diplomatic leverage and are likely to prompt immediate talks with Israeli officials and NATO partners, an uptick in market volatility, and possible retaliatory trade measures within days to weeks.\n\nOther developments touched law, rights, humanitarian aid and public safety. A UN report says Iran uses drones, facial recognition and a citizen app to enforce hijab rules, raising civil liberties and surveillance concerns that could influence sanctions and digital-rights debates. The UN secretary-general and top diplomats pleaded for sustained funding for UNRWA as Gaza needs grow, a request that matters for donor budgets and refugee protection. Domestic safety reviews found LA County firefighting hampered by outdated policies and resource gaps, prompting calls for immediate reforms and funding. Donors face near-term decisions on UNRWA funding, local authorities must enact firefighting reforms, and the contested Comey indictment will proceed into court.",
