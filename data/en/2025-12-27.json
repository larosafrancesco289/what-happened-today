  "summary": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has scheduled a Sunday meeting with US President-elect Donald Trump in Florida to hash out peace terms for the grinding war with Russia—just hours after Moscow hammered Kyiv with air strikes that wounded civilians and shredded infrastructure, according to the city's mayor. This high-stakes sit-down follows Kyiv's battlefield setbacks and hints at a seismic shift in American support, which has sustained Ukraine since Russia's full-scale invasion nearly three years ago. For ordinary Ukrainians enduring blackouts and bombardments, the talks could dictate whether respite or escalation lies ahead.\n\nMeanwhile, NATO mounted its first coordinated response to suspected sabotage after another deep-sea cable snapped in the Baltic Sea, mobilizing alliance ships to guard undersea lifelines critical for global data flows amid rising hybrid threats from actors like Russia. In Southeast Asia, Thailand and Cambodia inked an immediate ceasefire to halt three weeks of border clashes that killed 47 and displaced over a million, though Phnom Penh accused Bangkok of airstrikes on a northwest site during talks—prompting an emergency ASEAN huddle in Kuala Lumpur on Monday to avert wider turmoil.\n\nLooking forward, Israel's move to let over 100,000 displaced Palestinians trek back into northern Gaza after a hostage deal breakthrough eases a humanitarian chokehold and fuels fragile ceasefire hopes in the enclave. Elsewhere, a SpaceX Falcon 9 roared off from Florida carrying NASA astronauts McClain, Ayers, Japan's Onishi, and Russia's Peskov to the ISS, setting the stage for the return of two Americans stranded nine months amid Boeing Starliner woes and ensuring seamless US access to orbit.",
