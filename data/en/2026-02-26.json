  "summary": "The US and Iran held a third round of indirect nuclear talks in Geneva. President Trump deployed warships and aircraft to the Middle East during the discussions. No deal emerged, with prospects remaining unclear. This affects global energy markets through the Strait of Hormuz and regional stability in the Persian Gulf.\n\nNATO launched its first coordinated response after a second Baltic Sea cable was severed, following a suspected sabotage incident the previous day. The alliance aims to protect undersea links carrying Europe's energy and data. Separately in Sudan, a UN fact-finding mission reported that the Rapid Support Forces' 18-month siege of El Fasher in North Darfur targets Zaghawa and Fur communities for destruction, affecting 500,000 residents. The mission calls for intervention. In Congo, Rwanda-backed M23 rebels overran troops to enter Goma, a city sheltering 1 million displaced persons amid shelling. The UN warns of an aid crisis as the Congolese army retreats.\n\nChina's Vanke reported massive financial losses amid its real estate crisis, impacting investors, homebuyers, and an economy worth trillions. Israel allowed hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians to return to northern Gaza on foot after a hostage release agreement, easing a humanitarian crisis amid ruins. In Mexico, Sinaloa Cartel faction fighting turned Culiacán into a war zone, displacing thousands as government forces deployed. SpaceX launched Crew-10 from Kennedy Space Center with two NASA astronauts, Japan's Takuya Onishi, and Russia's Kirill Peskov to retrieve Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams after nine months on the ISS.",
