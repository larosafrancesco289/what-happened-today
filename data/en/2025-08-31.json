  "summary": "Russia launched a large, coordinated attack on Ukraine today as Kyiv said it struck refineries in response. Ukrainian officials reported strikes across 14 regions, with casualties including at least one dead and dozens injured, and separate early reports said a major strike on the capital killed at least 19 people, including children. Authorities also reported waves of drones overnight that damaged power infrastructure in Odesa and Chernihiv, leaving about 60,000 households without electricity and prompting Kyiv to vow retaliation. Fighting continues to disrupt civilian life and energy supplies across the country.\n\nElsewhere, world leaders met in China at a regional security summit where Vladimir Putin and Narendra Modi joined about 20 others, underscoring shifting diplomatic alignments and a focus on regional stability. In New York, the United States blocked a Palestinian leader from attending a UN meeting even as France pushes recognition of Palestinian statehood, highlighting divisions in international diplomacy. Israel said a strike killed Hamas spokesman Abu Obeida, a claim not yet independently verified. Researchers warned that climate change is slowing hurricanes and increasing rainfall, raising new risks for coastal communities, while Ukraineâ€™s president rejected buffer zone proposals, signaling continued resistance to demilitarization offers.",
