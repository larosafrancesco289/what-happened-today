  "summary": "China unveiled a wide array of new weapons at a major military parade today, a visible change in Beijing’s public posture that Western officials say is intended to signal growing military strength. The parade coincided with high-profile diplomacy in Beijing, where Russian President Vladimir Putin met North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, and with Russian praise for North Korean fighters reportedly deployed to Ukraine, a claim observers say needs independent confirmation. These developments deepen questions about regional security calculations and will likely prompt capitals in East Asia and Washington to reassess force posture and diplomatic strategies; expect renewed consultations among allies and possible sanctions or arms-control responses in the coming weeks. Analysts will watch closely for changes in force posture or joint exercises.\n\nOther major items were humanitarian and regulatory. Afghanistan suffered an aftershock after a quake that has killed at least 1,400 people and left thousands trapped, with rescuers deploying helicopters, BBC World reports. In Darfur a landslide killed at least 1,000 people and much of the area remains inaccessible to the UN and aid groups, Al Jazeera says. In policy, a U.S. antitrust ruling lets Google avoid breakup but forces data-sharing with rivals, a change likely to affect markets and competition rules. The IAEA’s finding of uranium at an alleged Syrian site and a U.S. strike on a drug-laden vessel near Venezuela raise arms-control and regional-security concerns; access and aid must be secured within days to limit further harm.",
