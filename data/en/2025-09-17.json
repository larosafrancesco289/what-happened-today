  "summary": "A UN commission of inquiry, reported today by the BBC, concluded that Israel has carried out acts amounting to genocide in Gaza, saying four of the five genocidal acts defined under international law have been carried out. The finding marks a major shift in international scrutiny and was immediately contested by Israel and some allied states; UN observers and rights groups called for accountability and further investigations. At the same time the BBC also reported that Palestinians are fleeing Gaza City as the Israeli assault intensifies, with bombardment prompting large civilian displacements and urgent humanitarian needs. The near-term implication is clearer pressure for legal and diplomatic steps: the commissionâ€™s report could prompt referrals to the International Criminal Court or sanctions consideration by governments in the coming weeks.\n\nOther global developments clustered around security, governance and infrastructure. In Cuba a widespread power outage left millions without electricity, Voice of America reported, underscoring vulnerabilities in infrastructure and public safety. Rights and rule-of-law stories followed: Deutsche Welle reported more than 140 environmental defenders killed in 2024, mostly in Latin America, and Colombia halted some US arms purchases amid a dispute over drug policy. Technology and energy policy also moved: former US President Trump announced a deal to keep TikTok operating in the United States, and European leaders discussed plans to halt Russian energy imports, shifts that could affect markets and diplomacy ahead of winter.",
