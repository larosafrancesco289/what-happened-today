  "summary": "Intense Israeli strikes on Gaza City forced residents to flee today, marking an escalation that has sharply worsened humanitarian conditions in the strip. Israeli military operations reportedly intensified in populated neighborhoods, and aid groups warned that thousands are displaced and in urgent need of food, water, and shelter; casualty figures remain contested. Humanitarian groups and some governments called for pauses in fighting to allow aid to reach civilians. The immediate next steps are negotiations over humanitarian corridors and international pressure for safe access to aid, with diplomatic responses expected this week. If corridors are not secured within days, relief agencies warn displacement and civilian harm will rise, increasing the risk of a larger regional backlash and complicating efforts to restart ceasefire talks.\n\nOther developments touched rights, governance and technology. Madrid-based NGO Prisoners Defenders says at least 60,000 Cuban inmates are forced to work, an allegation that could spur international pressure if verified. Cuban officials blamed sanctions and aging infrastructure for a nationwide power outage. The UN says Iran uses drones, facial recognition and an app to enforce hijab rules, raising surveillance concerns. The United States and China outlined a TikTok deal framework that could affect platform rules and markets. South Sudan’s opposition mobilized after Riek Machar’s arrest, threatening a fragile peace, and Papua New Guinea signed a defense treaty with Australia. These items may prompt sanctions, regulatory votes or diplomatic steps within weeks.",
