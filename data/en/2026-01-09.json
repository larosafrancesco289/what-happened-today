  "summary": "Russia hammered Kyiv with a large-scale missile and drone barrage today, killing four residents and sparking apartment fires, hours after Moscow rejected a European plan for post-ceasefire troop deployments. The assault, the latest in the war's fourth year, cripples Ukraine's civilian infrastructure as power outages deepen winter hardships for millions—much like last winter's devastating grid strikes. It underscores Kyiv's vulnerability even as both sides' peace hints fade, prolonging a conflict that has already claimed hundreds of thousands of lives and reshaped global energy markets.\n\nEscalations rippled across other hotspots. In Iran, thousands marched in Tehran and provincial cities defying a nationwide internet blackout, heeding an exiled crown prince's call amid fury over economic collapse and the Israel war; state media warned of mounting casualties as protests stretch into Friday. Gaza's healthcare imploded further, with cancer deaths tripling as Israel bars chemotherapy drugs—permitting snacks but not life-saving meds—leaving patients to die amid the blockade's stranglehold. In eastern Congo, Rwanda-backed rebels overran Goma, routing government troops and trapping over a million displaced people in the key aid hub under gunfire and shelling, per U.N. alarms of looming catastrophe.\n\nGlimmers of de-escalation offered cautious hope. Israel allowed thousands of displaced Palestinians to stream back into northern Gaza on foot after a hostage impasse eased, clearing paths for tentative reconstruction in ruined zones. NATO kicked off its first joint operation to guard Baltic Sea cables severed in suspected sabotage, signaling a unified front against hybrid threats from Russia. These moves, alongside a Syrian ceasefire in Aleppo after 22 deaths, hint at fragile pauses that could shape 2025's volatile security landscape.",
