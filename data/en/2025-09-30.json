  "summary": "The most important development today was former President Donald Trump unveiling a Gaza peace plan that he says would immediately end the war, boost aid to Gaza, and pressure Hamas to release hostages; his claim that it would immediately end the war is contested and depends on acceptance by regional and Israeli leaders (NPR). Leaders in the Middle East and Europe publicly welcomed the proposal, while Trump warned that if Hamas rejects it the United States will back Israel to \"finish the job\" of destroying the threat (BBC). The near-term step is diplomatic outreach to secure leader endorsement and negotiations with Palestinian representatives; if Hamas refuses, the plan could increase the risk of expanded military action with U.S. support.\n\nOther news clustered around security, governance, environment and science. Police in Michigan say all victims were accounted for after a church shooting that killed four and the suspect was killed in a police shootout (NPR), closing that local public-safety incident. YouTube agreed to pay $24 million to settle lawsuits over January 6 suspensions, a resolution that could influence platform moderation and political-speech litigation (NPR). Somalia plans its first oil drilling in coming months, a potential economic turning point markets and investors will watch. NASA and SpaceX launched a replacement crew to the ISS so two astronauts can return, and Namibia deployed soldiers to fight a wildfire burning roughly a third of Etosha, threatening wildlife and tourism.",
