  "summary": "A catastrophic collapse at the Rubaya coltan mine in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo claimed over 200 lives, exposing the deadly perils of artisanal mining that supplies 15% of the world's coltan—essential for capacitors in smartphones and electric vehicles. The disaster disrupts tantalum supply chains at a time when global demand surges amid the green energy transition, while bereaved families in mineral-rich but impoverished North Kivu province demand accountability from officials probing lax safety standards. This tragedy underscores how Congo's resource curse fuels both technological progress and human suffering.\n\nMeanwhile, the US Justice Department unveiled 3 million pages of Jeffrey Epstein files, shedding light on his sex-trafficking network and naming figures like Donald Trump, Elon Musk, and Prince Andrew alongside government awareness. Victims hail the transparency as a step toward justice, though further scrutiny looms. Across the Middle East, Syria's President Ahmed al-Sharaa sealed a deal to integrate Kurdish-led SDF forces in the northeast, stabilizing post-rebel uncertainties since December 2024 and averting factional clashes. This comes as NATO launched its first coordinated response to suspected sabotage of Baltic Sea cables, deploying assets to counter hybrid threats from Russia amid fraying European infrastructure.\n\nForward-looking, Myanmar's military-backed party claimed victory in elections marred by UN-reported 170 deaths and opposition crackdowns, cementing junta control and dimming hopes for democratic transition as international condemnation mounts. The outcome signals prolonged instability in Southeast Asia, rippling through regional trade and refugee flows.",
