  "summary": "Rwanda-backed M23 rebels overran Congolese troops to seize key positions in Goma today, unleashing gunfire and shelling that trapped over one million displaced residents inside the city, according to UN officials. This dramatic advance in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo escalates a conflict simmering since 2021, where foreign-backed militias vie for mineral-rich territory; aid groups warn of blocked deliveries to a major humanitarian hub, leaving civilians—already fleeing prior violence—at acute risk of starvation and abuse, as Human Rights Watch highlighted militia atrocities in nearby Uvira.\n\nMeanwhile, US, Ukrainian, and Russian negotiators convened the first trilateral peace talks in Abu Dhabi on Friday, hashing out a Trump administration-backed plan to end the four-year war, with Donbas autonomy remaining the chief impasse. This diplomatic flicker occurs amid heightened tensions: NATO activated its inaugural coordinated response to suspected sabotage severing another Baltic Sea cable, targeting vital communications, while the Pentagon's 2026 National Defense Strategy prioritizes homeland protection and deterring China over aid to European allies—prompting NATO partners to recalibrate amid Russian hybrid threats.\n\nLooking ahead, Israel permitted hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians to cross a bisecting military zone back into northern Gaza following a hostage-release breakthrough, potentially jumpstarting reconstruction in the war-ravaged enclave even as the truce's durability hangs in the balance for ordinary families eyeing a return to shattered homes.",
