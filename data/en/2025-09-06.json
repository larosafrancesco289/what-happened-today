  "summary": "A landslide in Tarasin, western Sudan, has killed at least 1,000 people, the Sudan Liberation Movement (SLM) says, devastating a village and overwhelming local responders. The scale of the loss and the site's location in an area affected by conflict changed the immediate response today: rescue teams are struggling to reach survivors, authorities and aid groups are racing to verify casualties, and calls grew for secure humanitarian access. The disaster joins other recent crises where civilians face violence and limited aid — the UN has accused parties in eastern DR Congo of widespread abuses, and Israeli strikes have hit Gaza City — underscoring the near-term need for independent casualty verification and guaranteed relief corridors so medical care and shelter can reach trapped populations.\n\nElsewhere, Russia’s president Vladimir Putin said he rejects Western security guarantees for Ukraine and warned that any Western troops sent if a ceasefire is agreed would be targeted; his comments follow pledges by at least 26 countries to deploy forces in that scenario and complicate diplomacy and raise escalation risks. A UN report alleges war crimes by multiple actors in DR Congo, increasing calls for accountability. On non-conflict fronts, AI company Anthropic agreed to pay authors $3,000 per book in a settlement over pirated training material, a change that matters for copyright law and how models are trained. These political, legal and economic shifts could influence markets and policy; without improved oversight and access, civilian harm and instability may grow.",
