  "summary": "In West Africa, Guinea's junta leader Mamady Doumbouya has claimed victory in the presidential election, provisional results show, three years after his 2021 coup toppled the elected government. Critics decry the vote as held in a stifled political environment, with opposition figures sidelined—a pattern that entrenches military rule amid fragile transitions from juntas across the region. This development mirrors neighboring Republic of Congo, where President Denis Sassou Nguesso's ruling party yesterday endorsed the 82-year-old strongman for re-election in March 2026, potentially extending his four-decade dominance and testing the country's stability.\n\nMeanwhile, U.S. federal courts delivered setbacks to Trump administration initiatives. A judge temporarily blocked the end of temporary protected status for 300 South Sudanese nationals, safeguarding their work and residency rights past January 2026 amid heated immigration debates. Another mandated pursuit of funding for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, ensuring the consumer watchdog endures legal battles over its role in curbing financial abuses. This comes as the administration withheld child care funds from Minnesota over rampant fraud schemes, hitting families and providers while pressuring reforms—a reminder of tensions between federal oversight and state management.\n\nLooking forward, CDC data signals worsening flu season nationwide, with cases surging faster than recent years and hospitalizations climbing; experts urge vaccinations to shield millions through winter. In Iowa, voters head to polls for a special state senate election in Des Moines suburbs, where Republican Lucas Loftin challenges Democrat Renee Hardman—a GOP win would restore their supermajority, steering policy into 2026.",
