  "summary": "The day's diplomatic focus centred on growing uncertainty over prospects for a negotiated settlement in Ukraine after two high‑profile summits produced limited progress. President Trump faces obstacles in advancing a coherent terms package following meetings in Alaska and Washington, and that uncertainty is being shaped as much by allied responses as by private deliberations in Washington: European leaders have rushed to the United States to deter shifts that might undercut existing security frameworks, while post‑summit assessments highlighted cautious, incremental movement rather than a breakthrough. In Washington, Ukraine’s president avoided a potentially tense Oval Office meeting, signalling a preference for calibrated engagement even as advisers debate the scope and durability of security guarantees. These linked dynamics suggest actors are repositioning to preserve options rather than to finalise a settlement, with alliance cohesion and U.S. domestic politics constraining negotiators’ flexibility.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, an array of domestic governance and humanitarian developments underscores operational strains that cut across borders. Migration and aid pressures are being reshaped as the U.S. secures deportation agreements with Honduras and Uganda while trucks and queues form at Rafah awaiting entry to Gaza, and Bolivia’s election—likely to install a non‑left president after two decades—could alter regional cooperation and migration patterns. In parallel, states are addressing acute public‑safety and infrastructure risks: engineers relocating a 113‑year‑old wooden church to avert subsidence, a U.S. recall of shrimp over possible radiation concerns, and renewed calls for clearer travel guidance after methanol poisonings in Laos. Underscoring the informational dimension, the White House launched a TikTok presence as lawmakers delay a sale‑or‑ban decision, illustrating how messaging platforms intersect with regulatory uncertainty. Together these developments point to heightened policy fragmentation; markets and humanitarian responders should expect elevated operational risks, while societies will face concurrent pressures on mobility, safety and information governance.",
