  "summary": "President Donald Trump kicked off his second term with a dramatic executive order withdrawing the United States from the World Health Organization, slashing over $700 million in annual U.S. funding to the Geneva-based body. This move revives his first-term criticisms of the WHO's COVID-19 response and perceived bias toward China, but critics warn it could hobble global health coordination amid rising threats like bird flu outbreaks, leaving poorer nations more vulnerable and straining alliances built over decades.\n\nThe order drew fresh scrutiny as former special counsel Jack Smith testified before the House Judiciary Committee, detailing how Trump allegedly exploited supporters to challenge the 2020 election, culminating in the January 6 Capitol riot. His accounts of witness intimidation and pressure campaigns fuel ongoing legal battles, even as Trump consolidates power. Meanwhile, disasters compounded global woes: Spain's death toll from a high-speed train derailment in Andalusia rose to 45 after recovering two more bodies, sparking investigations into rail safety amid Europe's aging infrastructure; Pakistan confirmed 67 dead in a Karachi mall fire, highlighting urban fire code failures; and a New Zealand landslide killed two, with searches ongoing in rain-soaked terrain.\n\nLooking ahead, U.S., Russian, and Ukrainian officials plan security talks in the UAE on Friday to discuss ending the war, building on a recent U.S.-Putin meeting despite deep divides over territory. Israel eased restrictions, allowing thousands of displaced Palestinians to return to northern Gaza post-hostage deal, offering humanitarian relief but not resolving the enclave's divisions. In tech, Peking University researchers unveiled an analogue AI chip 12 times faster than rivals while using 1/200th the energy, promising greener computing for everything from recommendations to image analysis.",
