  "summary": "US special forces raided Nicolas Maduro's Caracas residence on Saturday, capturing Venezuela's ousted leader and his wife on narcoterrorism and drug trafficking charges—a bold assertion of American power in Latin America after years of sanctions stalemate. President Trump quickly announced that Venezuelan officials would ship 30-50 million barrels of sanctioned oil directly to the US, the first major concession from Caracas. This chain of events stabilizes US energy supplies amid global volatility while pressuring authoritarian holdouts, though Asian strongmen are reportedly drawing closer to Russia and China in response.\n\nThe drama unfolded as chaos engulfed eastern Congo, where Rwanda-backed M23 rebels overran government troops and entered Goma city amid gunfire and shelling, cramming over one million displaced people into aid hubs. UN officials scrambled an emergency response, warning of deepened humanitarian crisis and threats to regional stability. Meanwhile, in Europe, Britain and France finalized postwar troop commitments to Ukraine—despite Moscow's rebuffs—while NATO launched its first coordinated assets to probe suspected sabotage of another Baltic Sea cable, underscoring hybrid threats to critical energy and communications links from Kaliningrad to Stockholm.\n\nAs Maduro and his wife pleaded not guilty in New York federal court, their trial promises to expose Venezuela's criminal networks, potentially reshaping counternarcotics across the hemisphere and signaling tougher US stances toward rogue regimes worldwide.",
