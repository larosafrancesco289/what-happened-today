  "summary": "Today NATO announced an expanded mission on its eastern flank after what allies say was a Russian drone incursion into Polish airspace: Denmark, France and Germany are sending jets to bolster Poland’s air defences and will begin joint patrols and heightened readiness in coming days. The move reflects broader concerns about the rising use of unmanned aircraft internationally, from the contested cross-border drone incident that prompted the deployment to a United Nations report that says Iran uses drones and facial-recognition tools to enforce hijab rules. Near term, NATO will test new airspace monitoring and rules of engagement; the next step is operational patrols whose encounters carry the concrete risk of miscalculation or an unintended shoot‑down.\n\nDevelopments clustered around security, governance and safety. Investigators say they arrested an alleged killer in the shooting of commentator Charlie Kirk and prosecutors are preparing charges. In Brazil, Operation World Cup uncovered a plot to assassinate a supreme court judge, highlighting threats to democratic institutions. Diplomats from the US, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Egypt proposed a roadmap toward a Sudan truce and civilian-led transition. In northwest DR Congo, officials say at least 193 people died in two boat accidents, prompting calls for better inland-water safety. France faces political and fiscal strain as deputies press for a Zucman wealth tax and Fitch downgraded the sovereign rating, a move markets will watch as borrowing costs could rise; rescue teams are searching.",
