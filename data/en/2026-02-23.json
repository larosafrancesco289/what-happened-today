  "summary": "Hungary vetoed an EU package providing a €90 billion loan to Ukraine and new sanctions against Russia. The decision occurred on the eve of the second anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Ukrainian forces conducted a strike on a Russian pipeline shortly before the veto. Kyiv's defense funding is reduced as a result. Talks among EU member states on the aid package are stalled indefinitely.\n\nIn Mexico, military forces killed Sinaloa Cartel leader Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes, known as El Mencho, during a raid that resulted in at least 62 deaths. Officials confirmed the operation targeted the cartel head. Violence has erupted across the country, affecting 130 million residents. Authorities anticipate retaliatory attacks by rival cartels. Separately, Rwanda-backed rebels fired on Congolese troops inside the safe-haven city of Goma. This follows the rebels overrunning troops and entering Goma yesterday. The EU froze negotiations on a trade deal with the United States after a US Supreme Court ruling enabled President Trump to increase global tariffs from 10 to 15 percent.\n\nNATO initiated its first coordinated response to suspected sabotage after another deep-sea cable was severed in the Baltic Sea. The alliance deployed patrols across the region. Transatlantic data flows and security are disrupted pending investigations. Panama's government ordered occupation of Balboa and Cristobal ports at the Panama Canal, run by Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison. A Supreme Court ruling voided the firm's concession. Global shipping routes face disruptions as assets are seized. A US federal judge in Florida, Aileen Cannon, permanently barred the Justice Department from releasing a report on documents held by Donald Trump. The order cites potential harm to Trump and associates in a classified materials case. Displaced Palestinians returned to northern Gaza after Israel lifted restrictions on a military zone. UK police arrested Peter Mandelson, a former cabinet minister, on suspicion of misconduct linked to Jeffrey Epstein documents. A winter storm halted air and train travel across the northeastern United States from New York to Boston, affecting millions through Tuesday.\n\"}",
