  "summary": "Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, vowed today to \"finish the job\" as Israeli strikes in Gaza killed at least 60 Palestinians, according to Al Jazeera, marking an escalation that complicates diplomacy. At the same time, former President Donald Trump suggested a Gaza ceasefire deal may be near, per Deutsche Welle, even as Netanyahu rejects a Palestinian state. A separate development—the return of UN sanctions on Iran after an unsuccessful delay attempt, reported by Al Jazeera—could harden regional alignments and affect prospects for a negotiated pause. Diplomats face urgent pressure to secure a ceasefire or risk broader regional spillover; expect intensified shuttle diplomacy and possible sanctions moves in the coming days.\n\nElsewhere, legal rulings, rights restrictions and security incidents reshaped policy choices and civil liberties. The U.S. Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to withhold about $4 billion in foreign aid, per NPR, a ruling that may alter how governments use aid and prompt lawmakers to reconsider funding rules. The UN says Iran uses drones, facial recognition and a citizen app to enforce hijab rules, raising surveillance and rights concerns, while Slovakia passed a law limiting sex recognition and adoption that critics say will increase discrimination. France's Sarkozy verdict tests judicial independence, and Danish reports of Russian-linked drone flights underline hybrid-warfare risks. Expect court appeals, EU debates and targeted diplomatic or sanctions steps within weeks.",
