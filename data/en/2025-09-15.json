  "summary": "IDEA says global press freedom fell to a 50-year low today, reporting democracy declined across 94 countries in the past five years even as roughly one-third showed progress. That change matters because free media are central to accountability: while Brazil's President Lula wrote in a New York Times opâ€‘ed that Jair Bolsonaro's sentencing confirms that Brazil's democracy \"is not negotiable\", the U.S. Fourth Circuit allowed directives limiting diversity, equity and inclusion programs in federal agencies, a move reported by Voice of America and likely to shape agency policies during appeals. Policymakers should prioritize legal protections and funding for independent journalism and coordinate emergency measures within weeks to sustain outlets and protect journalists.\n\nElsewhere, conflict and policy developments shaped risks and markets. Israel says 53 people were killed as intensified strikes flattened Gaza City towers, raising famine and displacement risks; Senator Marco Rubio visited Israel to discuss the war. The UN condemned a massacre in a Haitian village, urging investigations and humanitarian access. Non-conflict items include U.S. and U.K. plans for technology and civil nuclear pacts during a state visit, NASA and SpaceX's Crew-10 launch to the ISS to return stuck astronauts and sustain research, and Australia's climate risk assessment warning that rising seas could expose at least 1.5 million Australians by 2050. These events affect aid flows, trade and rights; urgent action is needed to open humanitarian corridors within days.",
