  "summary": "The UN General Assembly opened today as leaders prepare moves to recognize a Palestinian state, shifting a diplomatic spotlight to New York. Delegations debated recognition plans and observers expect multiple countries to announce support, a change that raises pressure on Israel, Hamas and key mediators. That pressure intersected with fresh diplomatic signals: the United States pressed Hamas to accept a hostage-release deal while Hamas said it was ready to negotiate, and Israel’s top court ordered the state to provide prisoners with adequate food, highlighting legal and humanitarian strains. Near term, UN votes and bilateral recognition decisions expected in the coming days could reshape bargaining over Gaza and hostage releases and are likely to trigger votes and diplomatic démarches this week.\n\nA catastrophic landslide in Sudan’s Marra mountains destroyed Tarasin village and, according to the rebel group SLM/A, killed at least 1,000 people; independent verification was not immediately available, and survivors and relief needs are urgent. A UN report accused all parties in eastern DR Congo of serious violations that may amount to war crimes, underscoring persistent civilian risk. Elsewhere, a US appeals court allowed federal orders limiting diversity, equity and inclusion programs to proceed, a decision with implications for federal contractors and universities. NASA and SpaceX launched a crew mission to retrieve two station astronauts, a non-conflict item that advances science and reassures families. These developments require rapid aid deliveries and legal reviews before next week’s UN sessions.",
