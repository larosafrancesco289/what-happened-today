  "summary": "Today, Gaza’s death toll topped at least 66,000, according to NPR, as Israeli forces intensified strikes on hospitals and high-rise buildings while Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu prepares to meet U.S. President Trump. The escalation has tightened access for humanitarian aid and provoked growing international calls for stronger civilian protections; observers warn that the coming diplomatic engagement could determine whether more aid corridors open or military operations continue unrestrained. Humanitarian groups and foreign governments are pressing for immediate increases in deliveries and clear rules of engagement; if substantial aid and safeguards are not secured before Netanyahu’s meeting with Trump, the risk of further large-scale civilian casualties and collapsing services in Gaza will rise in the days ahead.\n\nElsewhere, governance and non‑conflict developments stood out. Moldova’s pro‑EU PAS won more than 50 percent of the vote, France 24 reports, strengthening a push toward European integration while raising concerns about potential Russian interference and the need to form a stable government. Prosecutors allege long‑running sex‑trafficking abuses by leaders of La Luz del Mundo, a case that could reshape oversight of transnational faith groups. The UN says Iran uses drones and apps to enforce hijab rules, posing civil‑liberties risks. In science and markets, SpaceX and NASA launched a replacement crew to the ISS, and U.S. $100 million EXIM guarantee aims to spur investment in Africa’s digital sector. Residents were urged to seek shelter as Typhoon Bualoi made landfall in Vietnam.",
