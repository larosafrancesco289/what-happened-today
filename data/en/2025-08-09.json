  "summary": "Israel's plan to seize control of Gaza City framed the day's headlines, as the defence minister rejected international condemnation and potential sanctions, insisting they would not alter the government's course. Presented as a means to end the war by dislodging militant command in the urban centre, the proposal has provoked sharp debate both domestically and among international partners, who cite humanitarian risks, civilian protection concerns and the potential for wider regional escalation. Opposition at home—where critics question feasibility and political costs—has mirrored global unease over the plan’s scope and timing, intensifying scrutiny of operational objectives, rules of engagement and post‑conflict governance. As diplomatic pressure mounts, key questions remain about how an urban takeover would be managed to minimise civilian harm and whether legal and aid mechanisms can operate under anticipated security constraints.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, a series of diplomatic recalibrations and domestic political strains signalled shifting global alignments. Washington’s move to impose tariffs on Russian oil imports to India and Trump’s criticism of Narendra Modi have frayed US‑India ties and raised markets’ sensitivity to energy supply politics, even as Trump presided over a White House summit endorsing an Azerbaijan‑Armenia peace accord to reopen transport routes and ease regional frictions. In parallel, Latin American and domestic governance strains—Mexico’s president saying there is no evidence linking Maduro to the Sinaloa cartel, Australia’s convicted MP resigning after a court ruling, and Cameroon's long‑standing leader poised for another term—underscore contestation over rule of law and political legitimacy. Underscoring these trends, remembrance on Nagasaki’s 80th anniversary, together with scientific explanations about residual radiation, reinforced calls for restraint and public communication on security risks. Collectively, these developments point to elevated geopolitical unpredictability with direct implications for energy markets, regional stability and institutional confidence.",
