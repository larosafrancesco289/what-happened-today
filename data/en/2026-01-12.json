  "summary": "Tensions between the Trump administration and the Federal Reserve boiled over as the Department of Justice issued subpoenas to the central bank and threatened criminal indictment of Chair Jerome Powell over his congressional testimony about building renovations. This extraordinary pressure—unprecedented in modern U.S. history—raises alarms about the erosion of the Fed's independence, which has long insulated monetary policy from political interference. With inflation still a concern for households nationwide, any perceived meddling could unsettle markets and everyday borrowing costs.\n\nMeanwhile, NATO mounted its first coordinated response to suspected sabotage, deploying forces across the Baltic Sea after another deep-sea cable was severed, heightening fears of hybrid attacks on Europe's critical infrastructure. This vigilance echoes the clampdown in Iran, where the protest death toll has climbed above 540 amid economic despair and internet blackouts; President Trump revealed that Tehran's leaders have reached out for negotiations following U.S. threats of military action over the crackdown, potentially averting escalation but spotlighting America's leverage in global hotspots.\n\nLooking ahead, the International Court of Justice kicks off three-week hearings on Monday into Gambia's genocide case against Myanmar over its 2017 Rohingya crackdown, a ruling that could shape precedents for cases like South Africa versus Israel on Gaza. In Congo, Rwanda-backed rebels overran government troops to seize Goma, trapping over one million displaced people and straining UN aid efforts in the region's endless conflict. Upward, NASA and SpaceX launched the Crew-10 mission from Kennedy Space Center, carrying astronauts Anne McClain, Nichole Ayers, Japan's Takuya Onishi, and Russia's Kirill Peskov to the ISS, paving the way for the return of stranded duo Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams.",
