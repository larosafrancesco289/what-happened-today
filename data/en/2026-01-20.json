  "summary": "Rwanda-backed M23 rebels overran Goma, the key aid hub in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, today amid intense gunfire and shelling, displacing over one million people already sheltering there. The rapid advance, which caught UN peacekeepers off-guard, severs humanitarian supply lines and risks drawing in neighboring states like Rwanda and Uganda into a broader regional war. This escalation follows two years of M23 gains, fueled by mineral-rich turf disputes, leaving ordinary Congolese families fleeing for a second or third time with nowhere safe to go.\n\nEurope grappled with infrastructure crises of its own. In southern Spain, two high-speed trains collided near Altamura, killing 40 people and hospitalizing 41—including 12 in intensive care—disrupting rail travel and sparking EU-wide safety audits after crews sifted through wreckage for clues. This comes as NATO launched its first coordinated naval operation to guard Baltic Sea cables, severed again in suspected sabotage targeting data and energy links vital to the continent. The moves underscore rising hybrid threats, from state actors probing Western vulnerabilities to scrutiny of aging transport systems.\n\nForward steps emerged elsewhere: Israel opened a military zone bisecting Gaza, letting thousands of displaced Palestinians trek back north after a hostage-release impasse eased, hinting at fragile ceasefire progress amid stalled talks. In Bangladesh, Gen Z voters—44% of the electorate—head to polls for the first competitive election since toppling Sheikh Hasina, their choices poised to steer the nation's wobbly democratic transition.",
