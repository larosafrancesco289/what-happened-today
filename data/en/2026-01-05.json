  "summary": "US forces captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro on Saturday in a dramatic raid near Caracas that damaged an apartment complex, leaving streets eerily quiet and stores shuttered the next day. The operation, which comes after years of US sanctions and opposition calls for change amid hyperinflation and mass exodus, creates a power vacuum for 28 million Venezuelans and disrupts global oil supplies from the OPEC founder's vast reserves. Opposition leaders are already plotting a transition, but the move tests America's interventionist stance in Latin America.\n\nNorth Korea responded swiftly, with Kim Jong Un overseeing the launch of two hypersonic missiles near Pyongyang on Monday—a direct rebuke to the US action that Seoul and Tokyo confirmed as advancing Pyongyang's nuclear edge and rattling Asia-Pacific allies. Meanwhile, in Europe, Russia escalated with an overnight air assault on Kyiv that killed at least two civilians, even as NATO launched its first coordinated response to suspected sabotage of a Baltic Sea cable linking critical infrastructure. This comes amid Rwanda-backed rebels overrunning Congolese troops to seize Goma, displacing over a million in the aid-choked city and threatening humanitarian corridors.\n\nLooking ahead, Maduro faces a federal court hearing in New York on Monday, where charges could reshape Venezuela's future and US foreign policy debates. Israel also opened a military zone Sunday, allowing thousands of displaced Palestinians to trek back to northern Gaza's ruins after a hostage impasse eased—hinting at progress in ceasefire talks for the territory's 2 million residents.",
