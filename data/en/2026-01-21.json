  "summary": "Wall Street indexes tumbled on January 20, 2026, with nearly every sector posting losses after President Trump threatened 25% tariffs on eight European countries—Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Norway, Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, and the UK—over their refusal to cede control of Greenland. The Dow fell 2.3%, the S&P 500 shed 2.1%, and Nasdaq dropped 2.5%, erasing early-year gains and heightening fears of a transatlantic trade war. This escalation follows Trump's repeated bids to buy the strategic Arctic island, vital for rare earth minerals and military positioning, straining NATO allies already on edge from Russian aggression.\n\nThe market rout coincided with NATO's first coordinated response to suspected sabotage of a Baltic Sea telecom cable, deploying warships and underwater drones after the latest cut near Sweden's Gotland island. This comes as Russian strikes severed heat supplies to thousands in freezing Kyiv, leaving civilians huddling amid blackouts in sub-zero temperatures—a grim reminder of Moscow's winter campaign to break Ukrainian resolve. Meanwhile, U.S. forces seized a seventh Venezuelan-linked oil tanker, the Motor Vessel Sagitta, in international waters, further choking Caracas's revenue and bolstering America's energy dominance under Trump's assertive foreign policy.\n\nPresident Trump heads to the Davos World Economic Forum on January 21 to confront European leaders directly on Greenland, testing NATO cohesion and global alliances at a pivotal moment. With tariff threats looming and hybrid threats rising, the talks could either defuse tensions or ignite broader economic fallout.",
