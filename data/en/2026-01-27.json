  "summary": "A deadly Cyclone Harry has turned the Mediterranean into a graveyard for migrants, with Italy's coastguard estimating up to 380 drowned last week in multiple shipwrecks. Maltese authorities confirmed 50 deaths in one vessel and a lone survivor, while the UN verified further incidents. This tragedy underscores the perilous risks of Central Mediterranean crossings, where rough winter seas compound smugglers' callousness and pushback policies, leaving thousands dead annually as people flee war and poverty in Africa and the Middle East.\n\nSouthern Africa's summer rains have unleashed parallel devastation, killing over 100 across Zimbabwe (70 deaths), South Africa (30), and Mozambique since January, displacing hundreds of thousands amid crocodile attacks, cholera outbreaks, and looming hunger. Authorities scramble for aid as resources strain. This comes as NATO coordinates its first response to suspected sabotage of a Baltic Sea power cable linking Finland and Estonia, heightening fears of hybrid warfare targeting Europe's energy and communications infrastructure—echoing last year's severed gas pipelines.\n\nLooking ahead, Japan's new Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi warned that the US alliance could collapse if Tokyo fails to aid American forces attacked during Taiwan operations, signaling deepening commitments amid Beijing's assertiveness. Meanwhile, Indian PM Narendra Modi announced a landmark free-trade agreement with the European Union at their summit, creating a market of 2 billion people and 25% of global GDP to slash tariffs and bolster supply chains against economic fragmentation.",
