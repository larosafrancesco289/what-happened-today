  "summary": "The fragile ceasefire in Gaza advanced to its second phase today, with US Special Envoy Steve Witkoff announcing the disarming of Hamas fighters, infrastructure rebuilding, and deployment of Palestinian security forces—milestones from the Trump-brokered plan. This follows Israel's decision to open a northern military zone, allowing thousands of displaced Palestinians to return home after a hostage release breakthrough. For ordinary Gazans, the moves promise relief from 18 months of devastation, though skeptics question Hamas's compliance amid lingering distrust.\n\nTensions simmered elsewhere in a web of hybrid threats and attrition warfare. NATO launched its first coordinated response to sabotage of a Baltic Sea cable, deploying ships and surveillance to shield critical undersea networks after suspects severed the line—echoing fears of Russian meddling that have rattled energy supplies from Europe to Ukraine. There, Russian strikes plunged millions into an energy emergency at -19°C, as President Zelenskyy raced to restore power grids battered by drones and missiles, exacerbating civilian hardships in the grinding two-year conflict. Meanwhile, in eastern Congo, Rwanda-backed M23 rebels overran Goma, trapping over one million displaced people and firing shells into the UN aid hub, deepening what aid groups call Africa's forgotten crisis.\n\nLooking ahead, NASA's Crew-10 mission blasted off aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9, carrying astronauts Anne McClain, Nichole Ayers, Japan's Takuya Onishi, and Russia's Kirill Peskov to the ISS. Docking Saturday, they will facilitate the return of four crewmates—including the first medically evacuated astronauts Mike Fincke and others—ensuring seamless rotations amid growing US-Russia space cooperation.",
