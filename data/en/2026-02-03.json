  "summary": "Israel and Egypt reopened the Rafah border crossing into Gaza on Friday after seven months of closure since May 2024, a critical step easing the enclave's humanitarian crisis amid a fragile ceasefire. The move allows desperately needed aid trucks and civilian evacuations, following Israel's permissions for displaced families to cross a military zone back to northern Gaza and for five patients to exit for medical treatment—though one Palestinian was killed in the process. For Gaza's 2.3 million residents, starved of supplies and medicine, this signals tentative relief but underscores how border access hinges on volatile security pacts.\n\nThis comes as Middle East tensions show glimmers of diplomacy: Iran's president directed his foreign minister to pursue 'fair negotiations' with the United States, paving the way for a Friday meeting in Istanbul between President Trump's Middle East envoy—his son-in-law—and Iran's top diplomat, despite recent U.S. threats. The talks aim to defuse nuclear standoffs and regional clashes, watched closely by policymakers in Tehran and Washington. Meanwhile, Trump's administration faces a federal lawsuit from nonprofits and U.S. citizens challenging its visa suspension for immigrants from 75 countries, nearly half the world's nations, delaying families and workers as courts weigh legality.\n\nLooking ahead, a SpaceX Falcon 9 launched NASA's Crew-10 mission from Kennedy Space Center at 7:03 p.m. Friday, carrying astronauts including Americans Anne McClain and Nichole Ayers to retrieve Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams—stuck aboard the ISS for nine months—docking Saturday for their long-awaited return. House GOP leaders, led by Speaker Mike Johnson, gear up for a Tuesday vote to fund the government and avert a partial shutdown, ensuring continuity for federal workers past key deadlines.",
