  "summary": "Palestinian gunmen killed at least six people at a Jerusalem bus stop today, and Israeli police killed two attackers, heightening fears of a new escalation in and around Israel and the occupied territories. The attack, which authorities and broadcasters including the BBC and NPR reported, came as the United States presented a new Gaza ceasefire proposal and as Hamas praised the operation, complicating diplomatic efforts to pause fighting. Israeli security forces have launched immediate investigations and stepped up checkpoints and patrols, and officials said arrests and intelligence work are under way; the near-term risk is more tit-for-tat violence and pressure on mediators to produce or abandon a ceasefire within days.\n\nElsewhere, several fast-moving political and strategic shifts are reshaping markets and policy. In media, the Murdoch family reached a succession deal that leaves Lachlan Murdoch in control of Fox and News Corp, a change investors and regulators will watch for editorial and governance effects. In France, MPs voted no confidence and Prime Minister François Bayrou said he will resign on Tuesday, triggering a cabinet reshuffle and immediate policy uncertainty. A Fourth Circuit panel allowed enforcement of limits on federal diversity, equity and inclusion programs, altering workplace and contracting rules. North Korea tested a new solid-fuel ICBM engine, a technical step that could shorten launch timelines and may prompt tighter sanctions or military readiness measures within weeks.",
