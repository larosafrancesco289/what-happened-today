  "summary": "The single most important development today is the shooting death of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at a U.S. university. The killing changed the immediate security calculus for political gatherings nationwide, prompting law enforcement to investigate motive, identify suspects and task campus officials with reviewing event protocols. The incident joins other strains on institutions — a Brazil Supreme Court justice broke with two peers by voting to annul a high-profile case, and a Russian drone incursion into Poland put NATO readiness under scrutiny — highlighting both domestic polarization and external security pressures. Near term, authorities are expected to complete initial probes within days and decide whether to tighten security at upcoming political events.\n\nOther developments cluster around conflict, rights and science. Qatar's prime minister said Israel killed at least 70 people in Gaza; that figure is contested and awaits independent verification, while Qatar called Israeli strikes on Hamas leaders in Doha state terrorism. Gaza City resisted planned evacuations as Israeli authorities showed proposed aid sites, affecting humanitarian access and civilian safety. The U.N. reported Iran uses drones to enforce hijab rules, raising privacy and rights concerns. In non-conflict news, NASA's rover returned potential signs of ancient life on Mars that require laboratory validation and review. MSF is backing an Ebola response in DR Congo to contain spread and deliver vaccines. Immediate risk: civilian harm could worsen unless aid corridors open within days.",
