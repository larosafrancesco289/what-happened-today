  "summary": "Rwanda-backed M23 rebels overran Goma, the largest city in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, on Friday, routing government troops in fierce street fighting and shelling that sent over one million people fleeing for shelter within the city itself. The UN estimates this latest advance exacerbates a conflict that has displaced 7 million since 2022, turning Goma—a key humanitarian hub—into a sprawling refugee camp and threatening to destabilize neighbors like Rwanda and Uganda amid accusations of cross-border meddling.\n\nThis surge in African violence echoes escalations elsewhere: in Gaza, Israel allowed thousands of displaced Palestinians to trek back to the north on foot after a hostage-release deal, signaling potential de-escalation—yet fresh raids killed dozens more, undermining a fragile ceasefire even as President-elect Trump named a 'Board of Peace' to mediate. Meanwhile, NATO launched its first coordinated naval operation in response to suspected sabotage of a Baltic Sea power cable, linking up alliance ships to patrol critical infrastructure amid hybrid threats widely blamed on Russia.\n\nForward momentum emerged on multiple fronts. Canada and China slashed tariffs on electric vehicles and canola oil, boosting trade and helping Ottawa diversify from U.S. reliance. A Ugandan trial found insecticide-treated baby wraps cutting infant malaria infections by two-thirds, a low-cost innovation poised to save lives across malaria hotspots in Africa, Asia, and Latin America.",
