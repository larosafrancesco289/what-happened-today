  "summary": "An Iranian official confirmed at least 5,000 deaths in the country's recent protests, including 500 security personnel, marking the deadliest unrest in decades. The toll, verified amid clashes across major cities, highlights how economic hardship and demands for reform have fueled nationwide violence, surpassing even the 2009 Green Movement. This escalation has intensified international pressure on Tehran for restraint, raising fears of further instability in the oil-rich nation.\n\nDisasters compounded global woes today. In Spain, a high-speed train from Málaga to Madrid derailed near Córdoba and collided with another, killing 39 among over 400 passengers—the deadliest rail crash in over a decade—and prompting urgent safety probes. Across the Atlantic, wildfires ravaged Chile's Biobío region, claiming 16 lives, destroying neighborhoods, and displacing thousands as mayors plead for national aid amid climate-amplified blazes. This comes as Israel eased restrictions by opening a northern Gaza corridor, allowing thousands of displaced Palestinians to return home after a hostage impasse broke, offering rare humanitarian relief in the enclave's protracted conflict.\n\nLooking ahead, world leaders gathered at Davos for the World Economic Forum, where U.S. President Trump discussed soaring inequality as billionaires amassed trillions. EU ambassadors, meanwhile, chose negotiation over retaliation against Trump's tariff threats, scheduling Brussels talks to safeguard transatlantic trade. NATO also launched its first coordinated response to a severed Baltic Sea cable, suspected sabotage underscoring hybrid threats to energy and communications infrastructure.",
