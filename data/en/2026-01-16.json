  "summary": "Russia intensified its war on Ukraine's civilians this winter with its most devastating strikes yet on heating and power grids, blacking out cities like Kyiv and leaving millions shivering in sub-zero temperatures. The barrages of drones and missiles, the largest since autumn, expose Ukraine's fragile energy system—already battered by two years of conflict—and underscore Moscow's strategy to erode public resilience even as frontlines in the east remain frozen. Repairs are underway, but the attacks risk a humanitarian crisis deeper than last winter's blackouts.\n\nThis escalation coincides with other global flashpoints testing alliances and institutions. In eastern Congo, Rwanda-backed rebels overran Goma amid gunfire and shelling, trapping over one million displaced residents and overwhelming aid efforts as UN teams scramble evacuations amid Rwanda-DRC tensions. Meanwhile, a South Korean court sentenced former President Yoon Suk-yeol to five years in prison for obstructing justice over his failed December 2024 martial law declaration, a verdict reinforcing democratic checks in a region wary of authoritarian drifts. NATO, for its part, launched its first coordinated response to suspected sabotage of a Baltic Sea cable, signaling unified deterrence against hybrid threats from Russia.\n\nLooking ahead, Ugandan researchers unveiled a game-changer against malaria: cloth wraps treated with permethrin slashed infant infections by two-thirds in trials, offering a cheap, scalable shield for babies in Africa, Asia, and Latin America as climate shifts boost daytime mosquito bites. With malaria killing 600,000 yearly, mostly children, this could save countless lives if rolled out widely.",
