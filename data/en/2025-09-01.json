  "summary": "Russia launched a wave of strikes across Ukraine, with Kyiv saying missiles and shelling hit 14 regions as fighting escalated. Officials reported at least one death and about 30 injuries from the wider attacks, and a separate assault on the capital left at least 19 people dead, including four children, according to authorities and witnesses. The sharp increase in hits across multiple fronts has put civilians and infrastructure under growing strain. At the same time, Israeli forces said they had killed Hamas spokesman Abu Obeida in Gaza strikes on Saturday, a claim Hamas has not confirmed, marking another flashpoint in regional violence.\n\nNew video released by officials shows Israel struck Gazaâ€™s Nasser Hospital four times, two more strikes than first reported, raising fresh concerns about attacks on medical facilities and civilian harm. Diplomatically, the United States blocked a Palestinian leader from attending a UN meeting in New York while France pushes efforts to recognise a Palestinian state next month, highlighting tensions at the United Nations over how to respond. Severe flooding also swamped a wealthy neighbourhood in Lahore, Pakistan, submerging homes and infrastructure. Taken together, these stories underline growing humanitarian suffering, strained public services and deepening political strains that complicate relief and diplomacy.",
