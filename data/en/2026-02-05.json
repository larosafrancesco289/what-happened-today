  "summary": "The expiration of the New START treaty has unshackled U.S. and Russian nuclear arsenals for the first time since 1972, erasing the last mutual limits on strategic warheads amid soaring global tensions. The United Nations warned of the highest nuclear risk in decades, as both powers maintain over 1,500 deployed warheads each. This development follows years of fraying arms control—exacerbated by Russia's invasion of Ukraine—and raises fears of a new arms race, with ordinary citizens worldwide facing heightened prospects of escalation in an already volatile era.\n\nThis comes as Ukraine and Russia held a second day of U.S.-brokered peace talks in Abu Dhabi, building on a productive first round with discussions on prisoner swaps and de-escalation steps, though Moscow's hardline demands persist despite ongoing strikes. NATO, meanwhile, launched its first coordinated defense against suspected sabotage after another Baltic Sea cable cut, underscoring hybrid threats from Russia that echo the nuclear standoff. In Gaza, Israeli airstrikes killed 24 Palestinians—the latest in 556 deaths since the U.S.-brokered October ceasefire—straining mediation efforts and deepening the humanitarian crisis for 2.3 million residents.\n\nLooking ahead, Nigeria reels from its deadliest attacks this year, with gunmen slaughtering 162 villagers in Kwara state's Wuru and Nuku communities, prompting calls for security reinforcements against jihadist incursions. In Mozambique, floods have killed 150 and displaced 800,000 in the south and center, as aid ramps up for rebuilding—signaling how climate shocks compound instability in the Global South.",
