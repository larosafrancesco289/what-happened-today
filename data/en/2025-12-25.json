  "summary": "Two months into a fragile Gaza truce, Israeli strikes targeting militants have killed hundreds of civilians, including those on family outings in Gaza City and shelters in Khan Younis, leaving residents in perpetual danger from operations aimed at Hamas holdouts. This mounting toll erodes the ceasefire's stability, echoing the October 2023 war's devastation that displaced nearly 2 million. It coincides with Israel's approval of 19 new West Bank settlements, condemned by the UK, Canada, and Germany as illegal expansions fueling Palestinian unrest and dimming two-state prospects.\n\nMeanwhile, Rwanda-backed M23 rebels overran Congolese troops and entered Goma amid gunfire and shelling, displacing over one million refugees already sheltering there and sparking UN warnings of a humanitarian catastrophe in eastern Congo. This incursion threatens mineral-rich region's stability, mirroring proxy conflicts that have killed thousands since 2022. Across the globe, Ukrainian President Zelensky proposed withdrawing troops from Donetsk fronts for peace talks, following US-Ukraine alignment on war-ending steps short of full territorial resolution, offering faint hope amid Russia's grinding advances.\n\nLooking ahead, the Pentagon's report flags China positioning nuclear missiles for rapid retaliation despite slowed warhead production, while North Korea's Kim Jong Un inspected an 8,700-ton nuclear-powered submarine under construction—developments heightening deterrence risks for the US and Asian allies in an evolving arms race.",
