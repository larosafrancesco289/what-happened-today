  "summary": "Israeli strikes across Gaza killed at least dozens of people today, health officials said, as fighting intensified and aid workers recounted civilian deaths while seeking help. Forces struck Nuseirat refugee camp and other urban centers, destroying infrastructure, blocking routes and shutting hospitals, and nearly half of reported Gaza war deaths have occurred in areas Israel had previously declared safe, according to local authorities; casualty figures are contested. The change today was a marked escalation in urban bombardment and restricted humanitarian access, which will likely worsen civilian suffering and complicate aid deliveries. Near term, international agencies say they may suspend operations if routes remain blocked, and diplomats may press for temporary pauses to allow medical evacuations and aid corridors.\n\nElsewhere, responses to unrest and governance shaped crises and policy. In the US, the president authorized federal troops to Portland to protect detention facilities; officials cite security, while critics warn of escalation and civil rights risks. The UN reimposed snapback sanctions on Iran, tightening its economy and raising food and price pressures. In Sudan, sieges have driven near‑famine conditions in El Fasher and blocked aid. A political rally crush in Tamil Nadu killed at least 39 people and prompted safety probes. Non-conflict items include plans to roll out a generic HIV prevention drug in over 100 countries by 2027 and Moldova’s elections, which could shift regional alignment. Risks include disrupted aid routes and volatile markets.",
