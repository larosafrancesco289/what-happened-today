  "summary": "Israel says it killed 18 people in Gaza overnight as strikes widened around Gaza City, raising civilian casualties and complicating humanitarian access; the government’s claim and casualty figures are contested. The same day, Taliban authorities said an earthquake in eastern Afghanistan killed at least 2,200 people and a follow-up tremor hampered rescue teams, while a Sudan rebel group reported that a landslide in Tarasin village killed at least 1,000 people and left one reported survivor. International agencies are urging urgent safe corridors, rapid search-and-rescue support and a ceasefire or pause to allow aid to reach stricken areas; failure to secure access in the next days risks vast additional displacement and deaths.\n\nMoscow rejected Western security guarantees for Ukraine and warned such guarantees would undermine Russian security, a stance that complicates diplomacy even as twenty-six countries agreed to deploy troops in Ukraine if a ceasefire is reached; observers say U.S. backing will be crucial for enforcement. Elsewhere, the COP29 presidency urged richer countries to deliver promised climate finance, which matters for markets and for vulnerable nations’ adaptation planning, and the DRC confirmed its sixteenth Ebola outbreak in Kasai province, prompting calls for rapid vaccination, surveillance and border controls to prevent spread. A U.N. report also says Iran uses drones and facial-recognition tools to enforce its hijab law, raising rights and privacy concerns. These developments hinge on policy choices in the coming weeks.",
